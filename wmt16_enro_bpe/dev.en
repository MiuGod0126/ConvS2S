Brazil &apos;s Former Presidential Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff to St@@ and Tr@@ ial
a federal judge on Tuesday accepted the charges filed against Brazil &apos;s former presidential chief of staff for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme at state @-@ owned oil company Petr@@ obr@@ as .
the federal prosecutor &apos;s office said Jose D@@ ir@@ ce@@ u will face trial on the corruption , r@@ ack@@ et@@ e@@ ering and money laundering charges filed earlier this month .
four@@ teen other people will also be tried , including Jo@@ ao V@@ acc@@ ari Ne@@ to , the former treas@@ ure@@ r of Brazil &apos;s governing Workers &apos; Party and Renato de Sou@@ za Du@@ que , Petr@@ obr@@ as &apos; former head of corporate services .
D@@ ir@@ ce@@ u is the most senior member of the ruling Workers &apos; Party to be taken into custody in connection with the scheme .
D@@ ir@@ ce@@ u served as former President L@@ ui@@ z In@@ ac@@ io L@@ ula da Silva &apos;s chief of staff between 2003 and 2005 .
he was arrested early August in his home , where he already was under house arrest serving an 11 @-@ year sentence for his involvement in a cash @-@ for @-@ votes scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago .
prosecutors have said that D@@ ir@@ ce@@ u master@@ min@@ ded the k@@ ick@@ back scheme at Petr@@ obr@@ as , accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from contractors after he was j@@ ailed in late 2013 for the vote @-@ buying scandal .
according to prosecutors , the scheme at Petr@@ obr@@ as involved r@@ oughly $ 2 billion in bribes and other illegal funds .
some of that money was allegedly fun@@ nel@@ ed back to campaign cof@@ fers of the ruling party and its allies .
it also allegedly included the payment of bribes to Petr@@ obr@@ as executi@@ ves in return for inflated contracts .
&apos;@@ Mir@@ acul@@ ous &apos; recovery for Pes@@ ha@@ war massacre scho@@ ol@@ boy
a teenager paralysed after being shot four times in Pakistan &apos;s dead@@ liest terror attack has made a &quot; miracul@@ ous &quot; recovery following treatment in the UK .
Muhammad Ibrahim Khan , 13 , had been told by doctors in Pakistan that he would never walk again .
at least 140 people , mostly children , were killed when gunmen stormed Pes@@ ha@@ war &apos;s Army Public School last December .
Muhammad , who arrived in London last month for surgery , is being dis@@ charged from hospital later .
exactly nine months ago , on an ordinary Tuesday morning , Muhammad sat in his first aid class listening to his teachers int@@ ently .
at the same time seven gunmen disguised in security uni@@ forms were entering the Army Public School .
they were str@@ apped with explosives and had one simple mission in mind : kill every man , woman and child they came across .
&quot; I can &apos;t forget what happened that day , &quot; Muhammad says with a severe stare .
we were sitting in the aud@@ itor@@ ium , we were asking questions ... and then we heard heavy gun@@ fire outside .
the terrorists moved inside and they started killing - our teacher was burned alive .
Muhammad described pul@@ ling four other pupils out of the aud@@ itor@@ ium as the carn@@ age un@@ fol@@ ded .
he said he then heard his friend , Ham@@ za calling to him .
he said , &apos; oh brother save me &apos; .
I held his hand .
that &apos;s when I was shot in the back , and he was shot in the head .
most of the people killed in the attack were pupils
Ham@@ za died in Muhammad &apos;s arms .
Muhammad recalled bl@@ ac@@ king out after that , and the next thing he knew he was in a hospital bed , paralysed from the wa@@ ist down .
doctors in Pes@@ ha@@ war in northern Pakistan , and then R@@ aw@@ alp@@ ind@@ i , close to the capital , told his family there was no treatment , and he would never walk again .
&quot; seeing him I felt like my soul had left my body , &quot; says Muhammad &apos;s father , S@@ her Khan
those nine months were the hardest in my life .
but Mr Khan and his wife , Sher@@ ban@@ o , refused to believe that their cr@@ ick@@ et @-@ mad son would never be able to use his legs again .
they campa@@ igned , and appealed for help on Pakistani TV , gaining the support of high profile people such as cr@@ ick@@ eter turned politician Im@@ ran Khan .
finally , they were able to raise the funds to bring Muhammad to the UK and provide him with treatment at London &apos;s private Har@@ ley Street Clinic .
consultant neur@@ os@@ urg@@ eon Ir@@ fan M@@ ali@@ k described Muhammad as &quot; terri@@ fied &quot; when he first arrived at the hospital .
&quot; he &apos;@@ d spent the last &#91; few &#93; months lying on a bed , unable to move side to side , &quot; says Mr M@@ ali@@ k .
he was weak , he had a pressure s@@ ore on his back .
he wasn &apos;t in great shape .
a verte@@ bra at the base of Muhammad &apos;s sp@@ ine was destroyed
Muhammad was shot in his shoulder , his hip , and his back during the attack , damaging his lower sp@@ ine - leading to paral@@ ysis .
but during six hours of surgery , Mr M@@ ali@@ k and his team were able to re@@ att@@ ach nerve end@@ ings and re@@ construct the damaged part of the sp@@ ine .
even Mr M@@ ali@@ k was surprised at what happened next .
exactly one week after the surgery Muhammad stood up and started taking steps and walking .
we were not expecting to get that sort of excellent result .
that was miracul@@ ous , &quot; he says .
less than two weeks after his operation , Muhammad is ready to leave hospital and start the long road to recovery .
Muhammad has de@@ fied the od@@ ds and started to walk again
he says he wants to build his strength and continue his education in the UK .
but he says he is determined to return to Pakistan , join the army and help fight terrorism .
&quot; I feel like I have a second chance at life , &quot; he says as he shows off pictures he &apos;s drawn of guns scrib@@ bled out next to school books and pen@@ s
Muhammad grows physically stronger every day but the psychological trauma he continues to end@@ ure is un@@ imagin@@ able .
&quot; my anger is not dimin@@ ishing &quot; he says .
in my school little k@@ ids were killed .
what was their crime ?
his mother , wi@@ ping a tear from her eye , ca@@ res@@ sed his head and said : &quot; I can see my son walking again . &quot;
he &apos;ll be able to get on with his normal life .

Steven Wilson : &apos; if I don &apos;t do anything , I feel this cre@@ eping guil@@ t@@ &apos;
Steven Wilson was recently the big winner at the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson is often dubbed the hardest working musician in the world of progressive rock .
the multi @-@ talented musician won three prizes at this month &apos;s Progressive Music Awards in London , including album of the year for H@@ and .
the Guardian &apos;s five @-@ star review called it &quot; a smart , so@@ ul@@ ful and im@@ mer@@ sive work of art . &quot;
since the 1980s , Wilson has been the driving force in a number of musical projects , the best known of which is the rock band Por@@ cup@@ ine T@@ ree .
now , ahead of two sell @-@ out shows at the Royal Albert Hall , Wilson is rele@@ asing a vin@@ yl @-@ only double L@@ P , tran@@ si@@ ence , to show@@ case the &quot; more accessible &quot; side of his solo output .
he tells the BBC about his love of vin@@ yl , his busy schedule and explains how com@@ ic actor Matt Berry came to be his support act .
what does vin@@ yl mean to you ?
I grew up at the very tail end of the vin@@ yl era , and at the time , I remember , we co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t wait for CD to come along because vin@@ yl was so frustr@@ ating .
you would buy the record , take it home , and it would have a scratch , and you would have to take it back again .
I love CD@@ s , and for some kinds of music - classical for example - it is better than vin@@ yl .
but the problem with the CD and digital down@@ lo@@ ads is that there &apos;s nothing you can really cher@@ ish or treasure .
ow@@ ning vin@@ yl is like having a beautiful painting hanging in your living room .
it &apos;s something you can hold , por@@ e over the lyrics and im@@ mer@@ se yourself in the art work .
I thought it was just a nostalg@@ ic thing , but it can &apos;t be if k@@ ids too young to remember vin@@ yl are enjoying that kind of experience .
do you have a piece of vin@@ yl that you treasure ?
the truth is I got rid of 100 % of my vin@@ yl in the 9@@ 0s .
all the vin@@ yl I have is re @-@ bought .
I started off from the perspective that I wanted to recre@@ ate the collection I had when I was 15 , but it &apos;s gone beyond that .
the first record which I persuaded my parents to buy for me was Electric L@@ ight Orchestra &apos;s Out of the Blue .
if I still had my original copy , it would have sentim@@ ental value , but , al@@ as , it &apos;s in a charity shop somewhere .
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a do@@ or@@ way for potential new fans
why release your new comp@@ il@@ ation tran@@ si@@ ence on vin@@ yl ?
it was originally conceived as an idea for Rec@@ ord Store Day , but we missed the boat on that .
my record company had suggested I put together some of my shorter , more accessible songs .
I got a bit ob@@ s@@ essed by the idea to make something like &quot; an introduction to Steven Wilson , &quot; and I was committed to it being a vin@@ yl @-@ only release .
anyone who bu@@ ys the vin@@ yl does also get a high @-@ resolution download .
do you have a concern that the album won &apos;t show your work in a true light ?
no - because although I do focus on more long @-@ form pieces of music , there is one thing I have always valued above everything else : mel@@ ody .
there is a lot of progressive rock which focuses on the technical complexity of the track rather than the mel@@ o@@ dic side .
Pink Flo@@ y@@ d , the most successful progressive rock band of all time , have stood the test of time because the emphasis was always on mel@@ ody and atmosphere .
what do you have in store for your Albert Hall shows ?
I don &apos;t want to give away too much .
the repertoire will be completely different each night .
the first night is going to be a version of the H@@ and . Er@@ ase@@ . show I &apos;ve been doing this year - but on ster@@ o@@ ids - with a couple of guests .
the second night is going to be more of a trip into my history , which is more aimed at the fans have been following me for years .
how did it come about that Matt Berry is the support act on the second night ?
myself and everyone on the tour bus are massive fans of &#91; Channel 4 comedy series &#93; to@@ ast of London to the point that we are quoting it end@@ less@@ ly .
I thought that I should check out Matt &apos;s music , so I pic@@ ked up a copy of his Music for In@@ som@@ ni@@ ac@@ s .
I ch@@ at@@ ted with him about our love of Mike Ol@@ d@@ field and asked him to play at the Royal Albert Hall .
I &apos;m going to be incredibly star struck by my opening act .
you &apos;ve been re@@ mix@@ ing albums by the likes of X@@ TC , Te@@ ars for Fe@@ ars and Yes .
how much does that influence your own work ?
I don &apos;t consci@@ ously draw from that , but , inevitably , if you are de@@ construc@@ ting these classic albums they really get into your head .
my last solo album , The R@@ av@@ en That refused to S@@ ing , was without doubt the most old @-@ school progressive album I &apos;ve ever done .
I don &apos;t think it was coincidence that I had been re@@ mix@@ ing King CR@@ IM@@ SO@@ N , J@@ eth@@ ro Tul@@ l and Yes almost exclusively for the previous year .
the current album , H@@ and . er@@ ase . , opened up a lot more because I &apos;@@ d been working on Te@@ ars for Fe@@ ars and X@@ TC .
you are often described as progressive rock &apos;s bu@@ si@@ est musician .
is that how it feels ?
you can remove the word progressive .
I think I am probably one of the most work @-@ ob@@ s@@ essed people in the music business today , and I don &apos;t say that with any sense of pride because believe me it &apos;s a curse .
I think I get it from my father , who also had an incredibly strong work eth@@ ic .
if I don &apos;t do anything for a whole day , I start to feel this cre@@ eping guilt .
that &apos;s why the re@@ mix work has been such a gift to me because it means I don &apos;t have to be doing my own music all the time .
the music industry is a hard place to make a living for yourself .
I wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t recommend it to anyone as a profession now .
I work every day , and I &apos;m not rich , but I make a good living .
I love what I do , it &apos;s a privilege , but if I was l@@ azy about it , I don &apos;t think I &apos;@@ d be able to survive .

contract sees jobs fly back to Sky@@ trans
the new Sky@@ trans has re @-@ employed some of the airline staff who lost their jobs when the original Sky@@ trans collapsed .
re@@ born north Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and airline Sky@@ trans has secured a $ 25 million contract to transport natural gas company Q@@ G@@ C workers , which has led to 18 staff getting their jobs back .
the Wild family @-@ owned Sky@@ trans went bust in January , after the New@@ man government awarded the subsidis@@ ed routes that formed a large part of the airline &apos;s business .
the collapse led to several communities facing potential isolation , with federal L@@ N@@ P north Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and MP War@@ ren En@@ t@@ sch leading a ch@@ orus of criticism of the state L@@ N@@ P government .
another company , Col@@ l@@ ings Air@@ craft Holdings , re@@ launched the Sky@@ trans brand in March .
Sky@@ trans chief executive Michael Th@@ ine@@ e said the airline &apos;s contract with Q@@ C@@ G had already created jobs .
&quot; we have been able to re @-@ employ 18 Sky@@ trans staff back into full time employment as pilots and cab@@ in crew , &quot; he said .
we are also pleased to welcome new staff who have direct logistics experience managing flight operations for Q@@ G@@ C customers .
we have grown our workforce by 100 per cent in just five months , with 78 staff being employed in ca@@ ir@@ ns and now Br@@ is@@ b@@ ane .
the contract would see Sky@@ trans expand its flight operations from its ca@@ ir@@ ns headquarters , which services C@@ ape York and the Tor@@ res S@@ trait , to also include a base in Br@@ is@@ b@@ ane .
Sky@@ trans will operate 18 return flights per week for Q@@ G@@ C staff and contractors from Br@@ is@@ b@@ ane to sites in ch@@ inch@@ illa and Tar@@ oom on its 36 @-@ seat D@@ ash @-@ 8@@ s from Monday , October 26 .
Q@@ G@@ C managing director Tony N@@ un@@ an said Sky@@ trans was awarded the contract after a competitive tender process .
&quot; we &apos;re delighted that this contract will help a Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and company to expand , &quot; he said .
the Sky@@ trans contract maintains high quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects .
liberal MP and new m@@ um Kelly O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer told to express more breast milk to avoid missing votes in the chamber
more women likely for cabinet
Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bull &apos;s new ministry will be sworn in on Monday , with a strong indication there will be more women on the front ben@@ ch .
one of the government &apos;s rising stars , Kelly O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer , has been advised to express more breast milk for her newborn baby to avoid her bre@@ ast@@ feeding interfering with her duties in the parliamentary chamber .
the advice came from the office of the government &apos;s Chief W@@ hip Scott Buc@@ h@@ hol@@ z , who subsequently had to consult his Lab@@ or counterpart to find out how to better deal with a bre@@ ast@@ feeding MP in accordance with the standing orders .
liberal MP Kelly O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer with her daughter ol@@ iv@@ ia .
under the standing orders - the set of rules which govern behaviour of MPs in the chamber - new mothers who are bre@@ ast@@ feeding are given a pro@@ x@@ y vote in the Parliament .
this means their vote is counted even though they are not physically in the chamber .
but the W@@ hip was unaware of the exemption until he consulted the opposition &apos;s Chief W@@ hip , Chris Hay@@ es , about the matter .
the issue fl@@ ared up on two occasions when Ms O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer was unable to attend a division and a speaking obligation because she had just begun bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
on one of these occasions her office was asked whether the MP had considered expressing more milk instead of bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and MP Scott Buc@@ h@@ hol@@ z is the government &apos;s Chief W@@ hip .
the pair have subsequently resolved the dispute .
both declined to comment when contacted by F@@ air@@ fax Media but sources separate to Mr Buc@@ h@@ hol@@ z and Ms O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer told F@@ air@@ fax Media the Member for H@@ igg@@ ins was fur@@ ious at being told to consider expressing more milk over bre@@ ast@@ feeding her daughter ol@@ iv@@ ia , who was born in May .
the revel@@ ation comes as new Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bull works on the shape of his new cabinet .
Mr Buc@@ h@@ hol@@ z , a Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and Liberal National MP was promoted to the job of Chief W@@ hip by former prime minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , as part of the fall@@ out from the attempted sp@@ ill in February earlier this year .
Ms O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer , pic@@ tured with Lab@@ or &apos;s Am@@ anda R@@ ish@@ worth and son P@@ erc@@ y , is one of three new M@@ U@@ MS in the Parliament .
the former wh@@ ip Phil@@ li@@ p Rud@@ dock was dum@@ ped just days after Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t st@@ ared down a sp@@ ill motion to remove him as leader and was replaced with Mr Buc@@ h@@ hol@@ z .
another Ab@@ bot@@ t loy@@ alist , tas@@ man@@ ian Liberal Andrew N@@ ick@@ olic was also promoted and made a Deputy W@@ hip .
Mr N@@ ick@@ olic has made headlines in recent days , after it was revealed he tex@@ ted Mr Tur@@ n@@ bull demanding he rule out a challenge to Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s leadership .
Ms O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer returned to Parliament for the first time in August since giving birth to her baby ol@@ iv@@ ia in May .
she is one of three new mothers in the Parliament this year .
lab@@ or &apos;s health spokeswoman Catherine King said on Wednesday that the pro@@ x@@ y vote for bre@@ ast@@ feeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby .
&quot; he is now &#91; seven years old &#93; , &quot; she t@@ we@@ eted .
the W@@ hip should have known .
Ms O &apos;@@ D@@ w@@ yer was promoted to the fron@@ t@@ ben@@ ch late last year and could be promoted under Mr Tur@@ n@@ bull who on Wednesday said he wanted more women in his cabinet .
&quot; there is no greater enthusi@@ ast than me to see more women in positions of power , influence , Parliament , ministries , right across the country , &quot; the Prime Minister told reporters at Parliament House .
Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t included just one woman in his first cabinet and after sustained pressure to boost female representation in the Coalition , promoted a second woman into cabinet in the December reshuf@@ fle .
five things business wants from Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bull
Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bull : how will markets react ?
Busin@@ ess@@ Day columnist mal Mai@@ den examin@@ es what impact Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bull might have on Australia &apos;s business sector .
the business lobby could not shout its approval loudly enough on Tuesday as Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bull took the nation &apos;s re@@ ins as Prime Minister .
the key reason is that so much of what many of them would like to see had been taken off the table under the leadership of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
either that , or it had sunk into a negotiated stand@@ still through Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s crash @-@ or @-@ crash @-@ through political style .
with one voice the lobby@@ ists talked about a hoped @-@ for ability in Tur@@ n@@ bull to make the public argument , to cut the political deal and get tough things done .
so what exactly are the nation &apos;s biggest companies , and their lobby@@ ists , looking for in our new Prime Minister ?
Ch@@ AF@@ TA will be an early test of Tur@@ n@@ bull &apos;s ability to overcome negative public@@ ity .
Tur@@ n@@ bull himself put the China free trade deal up on the tee as an early goal .
in his first speech to the media announcing the challenge , the China @-@ Australia Free Trade Agreement ( Ch@@ AF@@ TA ) was the foc@@ al point for his attack on Lab@@ or leader Bill S@@ hor@@ ten .
in a speech in August , Tur@@ n@@ bull dec@@ ried &quot; ou@@ trage out@@ bur@@ sts of economic ch@@ au@@ vin@@ ism &quot; from Lab@@ or over the issue and raised concerns about a rac@@ ial edge to the criticism .
&quot; in the Ch@@ AF@@ TA context the winners overwhel@@ ming@@ ly out@@ number the losers , &quot; he said in the same speech .
business is p@@ inning its hopes on his winning this debate .
business legend Don arg@@ us was quick to make this a key point , he was echo@@ ed by the Business Council of Australia ( which represents the nation &apos;s 100 biggest companies ) , g@@ aming billionaire James Pac@@ ker and others .
business wants this deal done and it will be an early test of both Tur@@ n@@ bull &apos;s ability to overcome negative public@@ ity and also to negotiate with the sen@@ ate cross @-@ ben@@ ch .
small Business Minister Bruce Bill@@ son supports the Har@@ per Review recommendations .
this issue is shaping as a potential early ri@@ ft with the business community .
the effects test is applied in big merg@@ ers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition .
it &apos;s called an &quot; effects test &quot; because it takes into account not only a company &apos;s actions and intent , but the effect that they have on competitors and the market .
how that test is wor@@ ded is extremely important to the outcome .
the Har@@ per review of competition law recommended a change to the effects test that will make harder for large corpor@@ ates to s@@ que@@ eze smaller operators out .
under Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , the government was all set to side with the Business Council of Australia and the big retailers .
Tur@@ n@@ bull has now sign@@ alled he wants to have a full cabinet consider what to do next .
the BCA has jumped straight out of the blocks to say consumers will pay higher prices if Tur@@ n@@ bull takes up the Har@@ per review &apos;s recommendations .
one irony is that business has also strongly urged the new Prime Minister to have a greater respect for cabinet process , which is Tur@@ n@@ bull seems to be doing in allowing his Small Business Minister Bruce Bill@@ son ( who supports the Har@@ per recommendation ) to makes his case to his colleagues .

Ter@@ rence Howard challenges the times tables
Ter@@ rence Howard believes that we &apos;ve got ari@@ th@@ metic all wrong .
the &quot; Empire &quot; v@@ il@@ la@@ in told Rolling Stone that he does not believe one times one equ@@ als one .
&quot; how can it equal one ? &quot; he said .
if one times one equ@@ als one that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect .
one times one equ@@ als two because the square root of four is two , so what &apos;s the square root of two ?
should be one , but we &apos;re told it &apos;s two , and that cannot be .
we lost you there , Ter@@ rence .
un@@ surprisingly , Howard &apos;s teachers did not agree with his theory , and he subsequently left Pr@@ att Institute , where he was studying chemical engineering .
&quot; I mean , you can &apos;t conform when you know in@@ n@@ ately that something is wrong , &quot; he explained .
Howard calls his parallel take on math &quot; Terr@@ y@@ log@@ y . &quot;
the actor said he spends time cutting and re @-@ forming sc@@ iss@@ ors , wire , magn@@ ets and she@@ ets of plastic to illustr@@ ate his one @-@ times @-@ one theory and other similar theories he has .
he told the magazine that he and his ex @-@ wife Mir@@ a P@@ ak would spend up to 17 hours a day creating these illustr@@ ations .
the Rolling Stone writer described Howard &apos;s creations as &quot; building blocks but the shap@@ es are infin@@ itely more complex , in two dimensions and three , tied together by copper wire or held in place by magn@@ ets . &quot;
Howard said he hopes to inher@@ it U.@@ S. patent 201@@ 5@@ 00@@ 7@@ 9@@ 8@@ 72 A1 ( &quot; Systems and methods for enhanced building @-@ block applications &quot; ) , among others .
the &quot; H@@ ust@@ le and F@@ low &quot; actor also said that Py@@ th@@ ag@@ oras , Einstein and Tesla would &quot; lose &#91; their minds &#93; &quot; if they saw Terr@@ y@@ ology .
&quot; since I was a child of three or four , &quot; he said , &quot; I was always wondering , you know , why does a bubble take the shape of a ball ? &quot;
why not a tri@@ angle or a square ?
I fig@@ ured it out .
Howard added that he hopes to change the course of education .
&quot; this is the last century that our children will ever have been taught that one times one is one , &quot; he said .
they won &apos;t have to grow up in ignor@@ ance .
twenty years from now , they &apos;ll know that one times one equ@@ als two .
we &apos;re about to show a new truth .
the true universal math .
we &apos;ll have to check up in 20 years .

T@@ aco B@@ ell hopes wine @-@ serving &apos; Cant@@ inas &apos; will become urban hot@@ spots
looking for a sw@@ an@@ ky night out ?
consider T@@ aco B@@ ell .
on September 22 , the Mexican style fast food chain will open up a new location in Chicago &apos;s W@@ ick@@ er Park neigh@@ bor@@ hood featuring a tap@@ as @-@ style menu of appe@@ tiz@@ ers , a mur@@ al from a local artist , and even alcoholic beverages .
it &apos;s the first of the chain &apos;s &apos; T@@ aco B@@ ell Cant@@ ina &apos; test locations , aimed at catering to a younger crowd increasingly concentrated in city cent@@ ers .
T@@ aco B@@ ell , which has nearly 6,000 US locations , is rooted primarily in sub@@ urban areas and associated with cheap , quick e@@ ats , like the wil@@ dly popular Dor@@ it@@ os Loc@@ os T@@ aco .
with the average T@@ aco B@@ ell ta@@ b in the $ 7 range , the company has utiliz@@ ed drive @-@ through@@ s and fast service to attract the quantity of customers needed to turn a profit .
but to cat@@ er to Mill@@ en@@ ni@@ als &quot; seeking more urban environments to live , work , and play , &quot; according to T@@ aco B@@ ell , the test locations must follow a different model , with smaller foot@@ prints and pr@@ ici@@ er options .
to put in a drive @-@ thr@@ u you need land .
can you imagine buying an ac@@ re of land in a neigh@@ bor@@ hood like W@@ ick@@ er Park ?
&quot; you co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t afford it , &quot; Neil Bor@@ kan , the T@@ aco B@@ ell fr@@ anch@@ is@@ ee who will operate the Chicago location told USA today .
at the Chicago location , new menu items will be prepared alongside T@@ aco B@@ ell &apos;s traditional of@@ fer@@ ings in an open kitchen , where &quot; you will liter@@ ally be able to see the food &quot; before it &apos;s prepared , T@@ aco B@@ ell &apos;s Chief Development Of@@ fic@@ er M@@ ere@@ d@@ ith Sand@@ land told the Associated Press .
the new location will also serve wine , beer , and frozen alcoholic drinks , echo@@ ing recent moves by many of T@@ aco B@@ ell &apos;s competitors .
s@@ event@@ y @-@ five St@@ arb@@ uc@@ ks cafes now offer &quot; evening &quot; men@@ us that include beer , wine , and small sn@@ acks .
ten thousand out of Chi@@ pot@@ le &apos;s r@@ oughly 1,@@ 900 restaurants offer alcoholic beverages .
another T@@ aco B@@ ell Cant@@ ina location will be opened in San Francisco near AT &amp; T Park later this month , according to the company , es@@ che@@ wing a drive @-@ thr@@ u and parking lot for a pati@@ o and a p@@ ick@@ up window .

they have heated up their phones in the middle of the night : Elton John courts Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ ed Elton John on Monday night , just days after the British artist said publicly that he wants to meet the Russian politician to talk together about the Russian anti@@ gay legislation .
the British singer , a declared homosexual , tried un@@ successfully to obtain a meeting with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014 , a year after he de@@ fied the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013 in a h@@ ecti@@ c period in the history of this state , after the adoption of controversial laws which ban &quot; homosexual propaganda &quot; among minors .
in 2014 in St . Petersburg , the British artist critic@@ iz@@ ed these laws and stated the following in front of his fans : &quot; although I &apos;m gay , I always felt that I am welcomed here in Russia . &quot;
if I were not honest about what I am , I could not write these songs .
they do not mean gay propaganda .
they represent the way I express life .
if we begin to punish people for this , then the world will lose its humanity .
last Saturday , the artist revealed that he wants to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue .
so far , there is no clear information on the telephone conversation between the two personalities .
Cocos confessed everything in the National Authority for Property Rest@@ oration ( NA@@ PR ) file
businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a st@@ inging conviction , by &quot; singing &quot; everything to the judges and detail@@ ing how he gave millions of euros to the former members of NA@@ PR Commission .
interviewed yesterday before the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case in which he is being prosecuted together with his son Alin Cocos , the former head of the Directorate for investigating Organiz@@ ed Crime and Terrorism Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Est@@ abl@@ ishment of compensation within NA@@ PR , Dorin Cocos seemed to have been hit by the ligh@@ t@@ ning of sincer@@ ity .
he admitted all the allegations and told in detail to the judges how he helped businessman Stelian Gheorghe in the NA@@ PR compensation case , while asking instead to be judged more quickly and that his cooperation be taken into account .
Cocos stated that he has known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he be@@ fri@@ ended him after several real estate businesses .
he said that he met Sergiu Di@@ acom@@ atu in 2010 who told him he worked for NA@@ PR .
later I learned that ( Di@@ acom@@ atu , n.r ) . is the vice president , and due to the fact that Stelian Gheorghe has a file pending at NA@@ PR , I asked him to help us .
I promised him money , 2.5 million Euro , money that I said I will give in several instal@@ ments .
I also promised him political support to remain in office .
&quot; Di@@ acom@@ atu told me then that he will help me , but that he needs support , &quot; said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom .
he stated that after this , through an acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance , he came into contact with Crinuta D@@ U@@ MI@@ T@@ RE@@ AN , who was then head of the Central Commission for compens@@ ations , to whom he promised 800,000 Euro .
for the second case of Gheorghe Stelian , I knew that he wanted to get more than 300,000 Euro .
Di@@ acom@@ atu already had political support , I also gave him five million Euro .
to Crinuta D@@ U@@ MI@@ T@@ RE@@ AN one million Euro , to Bogdan Dragos I gave 800,000 Euro .
please note that I gave all this money in instal@@ ments to make sure that the case will be settled .
&quot; I only told them the following : solve the case , give compens@@ ations , &quot; said Cocos .
asked why he came to do these things , Dorin Cocos said he received eight million Euro for the positive settlement of the second case of Gheorghe Stelian .
I received for the second case eight million euros to solve the problem , but I was left with only 1.2 million .
in 2013 I also met Alina Bica .
&quot; we never talked about money or lands &quot; said Cocos .
he also said that &quot; it was a known fact that all NA@@ PR members agreed upon before the meeting . &quot;
I was not nervous about them giving a positive vote .
all the NA@@ PR positions were given politically , but I personally did not help Di@@ acom@@ atu politically .
&quot; I told him I would help him politically only to calm him , &quot; concluded Cocos .
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA ( National Ant@@ icor@@ ruption Directorate )
prime Minister Victor Ponta went to DNA yesterday for just five minutes , during which he submitted new documents in the file &quot; Turceni - Rovinari . &quot;
Victor Ponta ran to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice
convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is being investigated for forgery under private signature , complicity to tax evasion and money laundering , Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA , although the documents he had could have been sent though a lawyer .
it was not to be , as the prosecutor had no time and the Prime Minister left after five minutes , during which he left several documents at the Register &apos;s Office .
I wanted to submit ( to the case , n.r ) the resolution of the European Court of Justice of 3 September , which explains what happens to service contracts .
I say I performed works , the prosecutor says I did not , the European Court of Justice told us we should both mind our business because as long the taxes were paid , things are al@@ right .
&quot; from the point of view of the European Court of Justice , which is mandatory and certain for all European Union countries , there is no case here , &quot; said Prime Minister Victor Ponta , when he ex@@ ited DNA .
Ponta also said that , in his view , the European Court &apos;s decision should apply , if we are EU members .
until then , the Prime Minister expects the prosecutor to read the European Court &apos;s decision and to call him again for questioning , but also to give him a response to his demands , including the spl@@ it@@ ting of the file .
iohannis is rel@@ ishing his mandate without a TV
in today &apos;s Romania , there is no legal provision which forces you to watch television .
not even to own such a device , since the television fee is added to the energy bill .
but if you &apos;re the president , things change radically .
this is due to the fact that it is basically impl@@ ied that the Romanian president &apos;s job description states the president is up to date with everyday realities .
each day , president iohannis imm@@ ers@@ es himself in total silence in his office at Cotroceni
but , to the amaz@@ ement of even the closest of his people at the Cotroceni Palace , Klaus iohannis refuses to have a TV in the presidential office .
even after failing to watching TV - any program , even German networks like RT@@ L or Pro Si@@ eb@@ en - the president also does not listen to any radio stations or read any newspapers .
in addition , he does not even receive the &quot; negative monitoring &quot; for example . his predecessor requested it as a priority .
instead , iohannis only enjoys receiving the news reports which put him in a positive light .
bes@@ ide this inform@@ ational self @-@ isolation , in which the only break is when he acc@@ esses Facebook , even more serious is the block@@ age the president is pushing the overall activity of the Presidential Administration towards , by being passive .
this happened because , although a lot of time has passed from the moment he was brought into service , iohannis has yet to sign the loyalty statements for more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration .
this is becoming a growing problem , both in terms of human and legal stand@@ points .
all is quiet and peaceful
the presidential ent@@ our@@ age is already convinced that nobody and nothing can damage the &quot; F@@ en@@ g sh@@ ui &quot; of the presidential office .
a place of peace and quiet .
it &apos;s true that just after a minute to nine ( no more , no less ! ) in the morning , the former mayor of Sibiu requires the presence of the officials .
this custom probably remained from the days when he was the mayor of the town near the C@@ ib@@ in river .
the fact that iohannis does not want a television in his office has already given rise to countless legends , thus people in the Cotroceni Palace already tend to think that , by doing so , the president is trying avoid being monitored .
especially since he does not own any rad@@ ios .
but , at this rate , the next step is to med@@ itate in the dark , because even the il@@ lumin@@ ating equipment can hide audio @-@ video recording devices .
all is good
furthermore , another od@@ d@@ ity at the Cotroceni Palace is that only the &quot; positive monitoring &quot; regarding the president is delivered to the him .
that is , if there is any good news about Klaus iohannis or his wife , the president will receive the information on his des@@ k .
good news or no news !
even more interesting is that &quot; negative monitoring &quot; is forbidden , given that , for example , Traian Basescu was recogn@@ iz@@ ed not only for watching late night television shows he was critic@@ iz@@ ed in , but asking that every morning the bad news be delivered with priority .
that does not necessarily mean this was of any help , but , as they say , the gesture counts !
at least no one can ever say he was not well informed from alternative sources .
neither fired nor confirmed
after all , maybe the mystery of why Klaus iohannis does not want to watch TV is going to be solved .
until then , the resolution of the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the presidential administration would be more important , ir@@ respective of how it may be achieved .
in order to work , the employees are required to sign a statement of loyalty to the president in office , which must also bear his signature .
but , since December and until now , Klaus iohannis has yet to sign for confirmation even half of these statements , although this was supposed to be done within 30 days .
so hundreds of people representing over half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace are in an uncertain situation now .
legally speaking , if the president does not personally sign their statement , they should be fired .
the thing is that all these employees did not received any negative opinion either !
so , after all , after the inspectors of the Court of Auditors will carry out an investigation , they will find that for over half a year , many hundreds of people have received their wages s@@ ailing close to the wind .
that is until the president decides if he is going to fire them or confirm their positions , the decision being strictly his own .
teen was pl@@ ot@@ ting to attack Pope Francis during US visit , authorities say
a teenager &apos;s ISIS @-@ inspired plot to attack Pope Francis during his U.@@ S. visit was more &quot; aspir@@ ational &quot; than operational , a law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August , when law enforcement authorities fo@@ iled the plot .
the plot is the same one Rep . Mike Mc@@ Ca@@ ul , R @-@ Texas , the Hom@@ eland Security chairman , referred to during an interview on Sunday , a source told Fox News .
&quot; we are monitoring very closely threats against the pope as he comes into the United States , &quot; Mc@@ Ca@@ ul said on ABC &apos;s &quot; This Week . &quot;
Pope Francis was not named as the specific target of the plot in an Au@@ g .
14 FBI and Department of Hom@@ eland Security joint intelligence bul@@ let@@ in that said the teen planned to use multiple attackers , firearms and explosives to target a &quot; foreign dign@@ itary at a high @-@ profile event . &quot;
the bul@@ let@@ in said the minor was radic@@ aliz@@ ed via social media .
the teen may suffer from mental health issues , a law enforcement source told Fox News , though the source wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t detail specific@@ s about the teen &apos;s condition .
Mc@@ Ca@@ ul on Sunday also acknowledged the potential for a so @-@ called &quot; l@@ one wolf &quot; attack nation@@ wide and said he was briefed by the Secret Service &quot; in a classified setting &quot; about the pope &apos;s visit .
and with that comes a large security risk ... B@@ ut as that date approaches , I think we &apos;re all very vigilant to protect him as he comes into the United States .

medieval skeleton discovered in tree suffered violent death , experts say
archaeologists in Ireland have unearthed start@@ ling details about the strange medieval skeleton found in the roots of a 215 year @-@ old tree .
the be@@ ech tree in Col@@ lo@@ oney , S@@ lig@@ o , fell during a storm earlier this year , reve@@ aling the mac@@ ab@@ re sight of a skeleton tr@@ apped in its roots .
the Irish National Monum@@ ents Service brought in experts from S@@ lig@@ o @-@ Le@@ it@@ rim Arch@@ ae@@ ological Services to excav@@ ate and analy@@ ze the remains , reve@@ aling a gr@@ is@@ ly tale .
&quot; he had been killed viol@@ ently , &quot; Mar@@ ion Dow@@ d , director of S@@ lig@@ o @-@ Le@@ it@@ rim Arch@@ ae@@ ological Services , told fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.com .
we have st@@ ab wounds in the upper ch@@ est and they were inf@@ lic@@ ted by a knife - we also have a st@@ ab wo@@ und in the left hand , which suggests that he was trying to defend himself .
the skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20 .
radi@@ ocarb@@ on analysis has dated the remains to between 900 and 1,000 years old .
&quot; we don &apos;t know if he was killed in a battle or if this was a personal dispute , &quot; said Dow@@ d , noting that the body was originally buried in a Christian fashion with its head pointing to the west .
&quot; his family or community must have buried him , &quot; she added .
Dow@@ d told fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.com that wh@@ o@@ ever planted the tree was unaware of the grave .
&quot; it &apos;s completely co@@ incident@@ al - the context is unusual , &quot; she said .
there are historical records that say there was a church and grav@@ ey@@ ard in the area , but there are no remains visible today .
another aspect of the excav@@ ation is unusual - the young man &apos;s height .
&quot; he &apos;s 5 @-@ foot @-@ 10 , &quot; said Dow@@ d .
for early medieval society that &apos;s pretty t@@ all .
F@@ eds spend $ 1.@@ 5m studying how babies think about food
the National Instit@@ utes of Health ( NI@@ H ) has spent nearly $ 1.5 million studying how inf@@ ants think about food .
the project , &quot; inf@@ ants &apos; and Children &apos;s reason@@ ing Ab@@ out F@@ oo@@ ds , &quot; is being conducted by the University of Chicago and so far has determined that young children would rather not eat food that someone has lic@@ ked or s@@ ne@@ ez@@ ed on .
&quot; good nutrition is important for health and longev@@ ity , yet many Americans do not consume nutrition@@ ally sound di@@ ets , &quot; according to the grant for the project .
evidence suggests that inf@@ ants &apos; and children &apos;s earliest pat@@ tern@@ s of eating have lasting consequences for health across the lif@@ esp@@ an .
the premise for the study is that there is a de@@ ar@@ th of research about how babies think about eating .
&quot; despite the complexity and significance of food selection , develop@@ mental psychologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying how inf@@ ants and children perce@@ ive , learn , and reason about foods , &quot; the grant said .
the current proposal employ@@ s methods from cognitive development to test social influences on inf@@ ants &apos; and children &apos;s food choices and consumption .
the researchers character@@ ize inf@@ ants as having &quot; limited knowledge in the food domain . &quot;
children aged three to six years old are &quot; more knowled@@ ge@@ able than inf@@ ants and to@@ d@@ d@@ lers about foods &quot; but are &quot; notori@@ ously p@@ icky e@@ at@@ ers . &quot;

Super b@@ oss : six women on j@@ uggling mo@@ therhood and work
in the United States , unlike any other country in the world except Papua New Guinea , a centr@@ aliz@@ ed paid maternity leave policy does not exist .
two weeks ago , when Y@@ aho@@ o CEO Mar@@ is@@ sa Mayer announced she was pregnant with tw@@ ins but would be taking very limited maternity leave and &quot; working throughout &quot; her time off , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old was widely critic@@ iz@@ ed for propag@@ ating a culture which expects super@@ w@@ oman@@ hood or nothing .
but is Mayer , h@@ ers@@ el@@ f the ep@@ it@@ ome of a woman at the top , to blame for unrealistic expectations ?
how are other women leaders cop@@ ing ?
Se@@ ema Pat@@ el , a lawyer and deputy director of San Francisco &apos;s Office of Lab@@ or Stand@@ ards En@@ forcement , was taking her first steps at a government job in Washington DC a few years ago when her then b@@ oss sat her down with an unexpected piece of advice .
&quot; I don &apos;t know anything about you , &quot; her b@@ oss said .
but if you have any plans to have a family in the future , start saving your leave right now .
Pat@@ el &apos;s employer was the federal government , and she didn &apos;t get a day of paid maternity leave as part of her work arrangement .
back then , Pat@@ el was un@@ married and very career @-@ focused , and a family was the last thing on her mind .
but dilig@@ ently , she took her b@@ oss &apos;s word for it .
she avoided using her sick days over the course of four years so that when she eventually did have her first child two years ago , she had accumulated enough to get three months paid time off .
when she had her second baby six months ago , Pat@@ el could not pull the same trick .
the four months she took off were entirely unpaid .
Pat@@ el says she experienced no pus@@ h@@ back from colleagues , but it is the work structure she has an issue with .
&quot; I find it extremely un@@ sup@@ por@@ tive for anyone trying to have family , &quot; she says .
it sends a message : your country does not value you becoming a parent .
K@@ aren Cho@@ i , a vice @-@ president at asset management firm Capital Group , says that any working woman who is a mother should be applauded .
Cho@@ i , who has four children including a six @-@ month @-@ old baby , describes j@@ uggling being a mother and a job &quot; a constant struggle . &quot;
secrets for keeping your head above water include having an &quot; unbeliev@@ ably sup@@ por@@ tive family &quot; as well as a n@@ anny and bab@@ ys@@ it@@ ter , accepting that there are some areas you are not going to be the best at ( &quot; N@@ ot everyone can be the Mar@@ tha of home d@@ é@@ c@@ or &quot; ) , and simply getting through it .
Cho@@ i says she took more maternity leave with every child she had , starting with two and a half months with her first child , and taking six months off with her latest .
this makes her an exception , especially within her industry .
when your child is sick , has fever , is throwing up and you are up all night taking care of your child and knowing that the next morning you have to get your other k@@ ids to school and then you have to go to work ...
that &apos;s when it gets to be very challenging , &quot; she says .
her firm was sup@@ por@@ tive , though , and she stresses her investment portfolio &apos;s performance did not suffer at all .
when she entered the finance industry after university , about 20 or so of her female college mates chose the same path , she says .
today about 90 % of them have left .
women who exit jobs and then re @-@ enter are likely to no longer be on track for peak earning positions , she says .
staying is tough : &quot; a sacrifice in the short term , but it pays in the long term . &quot;
if nothing else , her children have helped provide meaning for this sacrifice , she says , because all four of her children are daughters .
one of the things that keeps me going is the fact that I would like to be a role model to them .
the notion of being a role model to her four children is also what driv@@ es 48 @-@ year @-@ old research scientist and professor Kelly Pos@@ ner .
they know that their mo@@ m is out there liter@@ ally helping to save lives .
Pos@@ ner , who is the founder and director of the Center for Su@@ icide Ris@@ k As@@ s@@ ess@@ ment at Columbia University , says it is important for women to know that they can have a &quot; big goal &quot; career @-@ wise and achieve it .
it is very important for women to believe that they can have a vision .
most women do not allow themselves to think that , &quot; she says .
she once gave a presentation to 200 people , including government officials in Italy over a we@@ bin@@ ar while eight months pregnant .
technology has also helped , she says , with the ability to stop the car and take a call after pic@@ king her k@@ ids up , or to answer an email on the go .
j@@ uggling mo@@ therhood with a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic , problem @-@ solving dis@@ position , she says - an ability to get through things even when they feel impossible .
Jennifer E@@ P@@ PS @-@ Ad@@ dis@@ on , 33 , the executive director of Wis@@ cons@@ in Jobs N@@ ow and a mother of two , says that only being able to make career and mo@@ therhood work together thanks to private networks of help - like n@@ ann@@ ies - is wrong .
&quot; you shoul@@ dn &apos;t have to get lucky or win the lottery to be able to succeed , &quot; she says , describing the systemic failure to support women and families - citing op@@ pres@@ sively low wages , a flawed health care system and a lack of mand@@ ated paid maternity leave .
&quot; as a society , we are not taking care of each other , &quot; she says .
we cannot even guarantee mothers who have just birth@@ ed a child to recuper@@ ate .
E@@ P@@ PS @-@ Ad@@ dis@@ on , who was pregnant while attending law school , gave birth to one of her children while she was on a fel@@ low@@ ship .
with a husband and off@@ spring rel@@ ying on the healthcare provided by the fel@@ low@@ ship , the lab@@ or leader was only able to take two weeks maternity leave , she says , before returning to work .
L@@ isa Mos@@ ko , a fashion sty@@ list and mother of two , says fewer women would be leaving their professions if more societ@@ al support were available in the form of company d@@ ay@@ care@@ s , keeping to agreed @-@ on sched@@ ules , and accepting that good work does not mean over@@ time .
on top of logistical constraints , Mos@@ ko says she has the added pressure of being in an industry where being a mother is sometimes sy@@ non@@ ymous with the ep@@ it@@ ome of un@@ sophisticated ( &quot; mo@@ m clothes &quot; being among the worst insul@@ ts ) .
&quot; image is part of your job - it can make or break you , &quot; she explains .
Mos@@ ko &apos;s &quot; constant negotiation &quot; of making her multiple roles work in harmony involves keeping to her ch@@ ic appearance , beautiful hand@@ bag on hand - but sometimes having a toy or two fall out of them .
remem@@ bering men are fathers too might help society cut women some sl@@ ack , she says .
people don &apos;t judge men for being bad d@@ ads as much as mom@@ s .
S@@ hol@@ a Ol@@ at@@ oy@@ e , the chair and CEO of New York &apos;s housing authority , which houses around 400,000 New Yor@@ kers and employ@@ s over 11,000 people , says that talking about &quot; balance &quot; is not really what mo@@ therhood and career is about .
the notion of balance is a bit of a mis@@ nom@@ er .
it &apos;s more like a Se@@ es@@ aw , &quot; she says .
the mother of three , including one three @-@ month @-@ old , took just seven weeks maternity leave when she gave birth this year .
&quot; it was a very important time for the agency , &quot; she explains .
she says she knew seven weeks wasn &apos;t enough , but her husband was able to take patern@@ ity leave and she has been able to have access to a flexible schedule that includes leaving early or coming in later so as to p@@ ump milk for her baby .
indeed Ol@@ at@@ oy@@ e , who goes on runs with her gir@@ l@@ friends every morning that end at 6@@ am ( &quot; cheaper than therapy &quot; ) , is still nurs@@ ing .
on the job , she has tried to create an environment that is &quot; parent @-@ friendly , &quot; where coming in late because of a k@@ id is fine , and answering em@@ ails does not have to be done from within the office walls .
&quot; the concept and notion of family has changed and is changing so much , &quot; Ol@@ at@@ oy@@ e says .
&quot; the family is very different from what it was like 25 , hell , 10 years ago , &quot; she says .
it &apos;s the workplace that has to adapt .
Russian pr@@ ank@@ sters say they fo@@ oled Elton John with Putin call
to cyn@@ ics , it had seemed rather too good to be true : a phone call from Vladimir Putin , the Russian president , to Sir Elton John , singer and LGBT campaig@@ ner , about gay rights .
unfortunately for John , it was , in fact , not true : despite an eff@@ usive Instagram post in which he thanked the Russian leader for having reached out to him on the issue , it swi@@ f@@ tly became clear that , wh@@ o@@ ever had called him on Monday night , it had not been Putin .
the Kremlin had already denied all knowledge of the chat .
and on Wednesday two famous Russian pr@@ ank@@ sters stepped forward to claim that they , not the president , had been the foreign voices at the end of the telephone .
&quot; we thought it wasn &apos;t likely that Putin would want to meet with him and call , at least not so quickly , &quot; said Vladimir &quot; V@@ ovan &quot; Kras@@ nov , who said he had im@@ person@@ ated Putin while his co @-@ pr@@ ank@@ ster , Alexei &quot; Lexus &quot; Stol@@ y@@ arov , had posed as the president &apos;s spokesman , Dmitry Peskov .
&quot; but it turned out that Elton John was really waiting for this call , and so he immediately believed it really was a conversation with the people who we said we were , &quot; he told told newspaper Kom@@ som@@ ol@@ sk@@ aya Pr@@ av@@ da .
he said : &quot; thank you , you &apos;ve made my day . &quot;
this day and this conversation has been the most wonderful and lov@@ ely in my life .
as if to complete John &apos;s embarrass@@ ment , the pair announced they would broadcast a recording of the conversation on Wednesday on a popular Russian late @-@ night show .
John &apos;s representatives have not commented on speculation of a ho@@ ax .
at the root of the saga are comments that the singer made at the weekend , in which he called out Putin about his &quot; ridiculous &quot; attitude towards gay people while lobbying for LGBT rights in Kiev , criticising in particular a Russian law passed in 2013 which bans the spreading of &quot; propaganda of non @-@ traditional sexual relations &quot; among minors .
&quot; I &apos;@@ d love to meet him &#91; Putin &#93; , I &apos;@@ d love to sit down and talk to him , &quot; John told the BBC , saying that , though the idea was &quot; probably p@@ ie in the sky , &quot; it was nonetheless worth a try .
then , on Monday night , the singer el@@ ic@@ ited incre@@ dul@@ ity from some observers when he posted a social media message declar@@ ing that Putin had responded to his critic@@ isms by pic@@ king up the phone .
he was , he said , &quot; looking forward to meeting him &#91; the president &#93; face @-@ to @-@ face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia . &quot;
Al@@ as for John , it was not Putin on the end of the line but Stol@@ y@@ arov and Kras@@ nov , who have pr@@ ank @-@ called many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians .
Stol@@ y@@ arov , who speaks English well , had played Peskov and pre@@ ten@@ ded to interpret for the two .
when asked about the possibility of a conversation , the real Peskov had told journalists on Tuesday that Putin would be &quot; ready to meet with Elton John among others to give answers to all the questions that he might ask , &quot; but said that the Kremlin had not received any requests from the singer .
the Kremlin had reason to question the Instagram post &apos;s authenticity , he added , &quot; especially because it &apos;s not entirely gram@@ mat@@ ically correct in English . &quot;
we don &apos;t think that Sir Elton John would have written so un@@ gram@@ mat@@ ically .
even before the Russian duo went public with their ho@@ ax , local media had been specul@@ ating that John had become the victim of a pr@@ ank .
some people online had even identified Kras@@ nov , who is known for fo@@ oling politicians with phone calls that he records and posts on his YouTube channel as V@@ ov@@ an@@ 2@@ 22 as the culpr@@ it .
pr@@ ank @-@ calling public figures and then publishing the recordings has become something of a phenomenon in recent years in Russia .
Stol@@ y@@ arov , who is often cred@@ ited as the father of the gen@@ re , has developed a kn@@ ack for pr@@ an@@ king Ukrainian politicians .
he has been interviewed over the phone on Ukrainian television im@@ person@@ ating Anton Ger@@ ash@@ chenko , the out@@ spoken adviser to the interior minister , Ar@@ sen Av@@ akov .
he played Ger@@ ash@@ chenko so well that he spoke to the former D@@ ni@@ prop@@ etr@@ ov@@ sk governor I@@ hor Kol@@ omo@@ is@@ ky for more than six hours over several days last year .
Kras@@ nov first came to prom@@ in@@ ence after the parliamentary elections of 2011 , which sparked a huge street protest movement after reports of widespread fraud .
pre@@ ten@@ ding to be then president Dmitry Medvedev &apos;s aide , Ark@@ ady D@@ vor@@ kov@@ ich , he convinced the electoral commission head , Vladimir Ch@@ ur@@ ov , that Medvedev intended to fire him .
besides numerous Russian celebrities , his victims have also included the former USSR president Mikhail Gor@@ bac@@ hev , Kiev mayor and boxing champion Vit@@ ali K@@ lit@@ sch@@ ko , and Russian sports minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko , whom he tric@@ ked into apolog@@ ising for his athletes &quot; dr@@ un@@ ken behaviour .
last year , Kras@@ nov reportedly called the Belarusian president , Alexander Lukashenko , pre@@ ten@@ ding to be the son of the ou@@ sted Ukrainian leader , Viktor Yanukovych .
he was so convincing that the cal@@ ler on the other end , whose voice sounded like that of Lukashenko , offered asylum .
John &apos;s initial statement that he wished to speak to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia .
the St Petersburg law@@ maker Vital@@ y Mil@@ on@@ ov , who helped inspire the gay &quot; propaganda &quot; law , told the Guardian that John should not distr@@ act Putin with such an &quot; ir@@ relevant topic &quot; and that he was ready to meet the singer to explain Russia &apos;s position .
the newspaper Mos@@ kov@@ sky Kom@@ som@@ ol@@ ets held an online readers &apos; poll in which 39 % of respondents thought Putin and John should meet , while 22 % said such a meeting would harm Putin &apos;s reputation .
more people die from air pollution than Mal@@ aria and HIV / A@@ ids , new study shows
more than 3 million people a year are killed premat@@ ure@@ ly by outdoor air pollution , according to a landmark new study , more than mal@@ aria and HIV / A@@ ids combined .
wood and coal burning for heating homes and cooking is the biggest cause , especially in Asia , but the research reveals a remark@@ ably heavy toll from farming emissions in Europe and the US , where it is the leading cause of deaths .
the report warns that , unless action is taken , the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths every minute - will double by 2050 .
&quot; this proj@@ ection should sound alarm bel@@ ls for public health agencies around the world , &quot; said environmental health expert Professor Michael Jer@@ ret@@ t , at the University of California and who was not involved in the research .
most air pollution deaths are caused by tiny particles that can be inhal@@ ed deep into the lungs .
these cause heart attacks and stro@@ kes , which account for three @-@ quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths , with lung cancer and respiratory diseases responsible for the rest .
the work did not include the effect of indo@@ or air pollution , from cooking fires for example , which is estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths a year .
the new work , published in the journ@@ al Nature , is the first study to single out different outdoor air pollution sources and estimate the number of premature deaths they each cause , considering road traffic , fossil fuel power stations and other sources .
the researchers used a detailed computer model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations , including new information on how pollution affects people in China and India .
a third of all premature deaths were the result of using smo@@ ky fuels such as wood and coal for heating homes or cooking and using dirty diesel gener@@ ators for electricity , all well @-@ known haz@@ ards .
this domestic energy use causes half the 64@@ 5,000 annual deaths in India and a third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China .
but the research found that agricultural emissions of am@@ mon@@ ia had a &quot; remarkable &quot; impact , according to Professor Jos L@@ el@@ iev@@ eld , at the Max Pl@@ anck Institute for Chem@@ istry in Germany , who led the research .
a fifth of all global deaths resulted from these emissions , which come mainly from cattle , chickens and pigs and from the over @-@ use of fertil@@ iser .
the am@@ mon@@ ia re@@ acts with fum@@ es from traffic and industry to produce tiny particles and is the largest cause of air pollution deaths in the eastern US , Japan and in Europe .
&quot; for London , agriculture is the main source , &quot; said L@@ el@@ iev@@ eld .
across the UK , 48 % of the premature deaths were ultimately the result of agricultural pollution .
traffic pollution was still important in developed countries , causing a fifth of deaths , despite crack@@ dow@@ ns on dirty vehicles .
it only caused 5 % of deaths across the globe as a whole , but this is likely to rise as more cars take to the road in developing countries .
air pollution from power stations , mainly coal @-@ burning plants , was significant globally , causing one in seven deaths .
it is the biggest single factor in the US , causing a third of the 5@@ 5,000 annual deaths , compared to 16 % in the UK .
natural air pollution , mostly dust in ari@@ d regions , caused almost a fifth of global air pollution deaths .
this source is a major factor in some dry countries , accounting for 92 % of deaths in Egypt and 81 % in Iran .
&quot; the over@@ lap of high pollution and large populations takes a huge toll on public health , but little &#91; was &#93; known about the pollution sources that are responsible for premature deaths , &quot; said Jer@@ ret@@ t .
the results are surprising and potentially important for protecting public health globally .
currently it is assumed that all particul@@ ates are equally toxic .
but if those from fuel burning are more toxic , as some scientists suspect , the proportion of premature deaths attrib@@ ut@@ able to farming emissions would be lower .
even so , Jer@@ ret@@ t said , &quot; the finding is highly valuable ... because agriculture has generally not been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death , and because it suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to agricultural sources , by both scientists and polic@@ y@@ makers . &quot;
Dr Oliver Wild , an atmos@@ ph@@ eric scientist at Lanc@@ aster University in the UK said : &quot; the study really brings home the need for air quality controls to avoid these additional deaths , particularly in heavily populated parts of Asia . &quot;
a statement of Victor Ponta makes relations with Hungary even more tense
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying . the Romanian Prime Minister speaks of attitudes reminiscent of Naz@@ ism
relations with Hungary , already ten@@ sed after the announcement of the construction of a fence on the border with Romania , after the one on the Serbian border , saw a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta . on Monday , he accused the authorities in Budapest of treating the refugees with violence and &quot; marking &quot; them with serial numbers . &quot;
Hungarian diplomacy reacted harshly , talking about &quot; extremist and false &quot; statements . Victor Ponta strikes back and accuses the government officials of the neighbouring country to be &quot; a disgrace &quot; for Europe .
it should be noted that this it is not the first time Ponta has tried to strain the Romanian @-@ Hungarian relations through statements made in delicate or electoral moments .
it all started in a statement made Monday by Victor Ponta , in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees .
the problem is our logistical problem as we want to treat those people as people , not as our Hungarian neighbours treat them with violence , &quot; marking &quot; them with serial numbers .
we do not agree with this .
Mr Basescu was put in charge of an ugly horrible feeling which exists in all societies , namely a xenophobic sentiment .
it &apos;s good to have debates , but the burden of solving the problem falls on us .
&quot; we are going to treat those people like we would treat ourselves , &quot; said Victor Ponta on Monday , quoted by Adevarul .
it is not clear what Victor Ponta meant when he spoke of serial numbers , but the Czech Republic has recently been in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of the migrants in several trains , a gesture that recalled of the procedure used by the Nazis to identify the He@@ bre@@ w prisoners in concentration camps .
according to the article of the MTI news agency and pic@@ ked up by mag@@ y@@ ar@@ id@@ ok@@ .@@ hu , Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to considered that the internal political crises which roc@@ ked Victor Ponta &apos;s position probably influenced him to make &quot; extremist and false &quot; declarations .
the Romanian charge d &apos;@@ aff@@ aires in Budapest was summoned to give explanations , reports Mediafax , citing MTI .
&quot; Mr . Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis , &quot; says the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Lev@@ ente Mag@@ y@@ ar , Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his &quot; surprise &quot; in connection with the &quot; constant attempts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position with anti @-@ Hungary lies , &quot; emphas@@ iz@@ es the diplomacy in Budapest .
&quot; I do NO@@ T want to respond to the challenges of some Hungarian government representatives - but please read the story below and you will understand the ou@@ trage that I feel as a man and an European citizen , in the context of ment@@ alities and attitudes which have be@@ een seen in Europe only in 1930 @-@ 1940 ! ! ! , &quot; wrote Ponta on his Facebook page .
he says that , like other European politicians , he has the &quot; duty &quot; to attract attention and sanction the &quot; constant behaviour of Hungarian government officials of the highest level &quot; who are &quot; a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union &quot; through their &quot; anti @-@ Semitic attitudes , &quot; &quot; the way they treat all minorities and now the refugees crisis ! &quot;
&quot; barbed wire , aggressive laws , prisons and brut@@ ally will certainly not solve the problem - the only thing this behaviour accentu@@ ates is that in the heart of Europe , in Hungary there are polic@@ y@@ makers who are no better than those in Syria , Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing ! , &quot; accused Ponta , saying that he believes in &quot; solidarity , rational and sustainable solutions , and especially in the super@@ ior@@ ity of European values . &quot; he also states that &quot; what we have recently seen in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values ! . &quot;
in the evening , Ponta was the guest of Antena 3 , where the main topic was Hungary .
if Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe , a dictator , Ponta won@@ dered what would happen if Hungarian soldiers would start firing or killing children and women , in a speech with several references to Naz@@ ism .
the president of UDMR ( Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania ) , Kelemen Hunor , intervened in the debate . he considers that the Romanian authorities should not have an &quot; emotional approach &quot; in relation to Hungary &apos;s intention to build a fence on the border .
the leader of UDMR said that what needs to be understood is that this solution is not directed against Romania and the Romanian citizens , stating that the fence might even help our country avoid becoming a route heavily trans@@ ited by migrants who want to enter the Schengen area , according to Agerpres .
firstly , I want to emphas@@ ize , to state that we should not become hy@@ ster@@ ical , and take the whole issue as something against Romania and it should not be used to aggrav@@ ate the not too good relations between the two governments , because it is not the case .
I think any sentim@@ ental , vis@@ cer@@ al approach is wrong .
&quot; we need to see the rational side of the matter , see why did it come to this and we need to know how to say it . the fence is not against us , is not against Romania and the Romanian citizens and does not prevent free movement between the two countries , in the European Union , &quot; said Kelemen Hunor .
the West ignored in 2012 Russia &apos;s offer to overthrow Bashar al @-@ Assad from ruling Syria
Russia has suggested more than three years ago the removal of President Bashar al @-@ Assad , as part of a peace treaty , according to a senior official involved at that time in the closed door negotiations between Western countries and Russia , states The Guardian .
the former president of Finland and Nobel Peace recipient , Martti Ahtisaari , said the Western powers did not take advantage of that proposal .
from 2012 to present day , tens of thousands of people died and millions were forced to flee the country , creating the worst refugee crisis since the end of the Second World War .
Ahtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council ( US , UK , France , Russia and China ) in February 2012 .
he also said that during the discussions , the Russian ambassador , Vital@@ y Ch@@ ur@@ kin , offered a plan that included , among others , the proposal addresses to Assad to step down at some point after the start of the peace treaties between the regime and the opposition .
he proposed three things :
one - the opposition should not be armed .
two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately .
&quot; three - we must find an elegant way for Assad to pull back , &quot; said Ahtisaari , re@@ counting the Russian ambassador &apos;s position .
Ahtisaari also said that the United States , Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall , that they ignored the Russian Ambassador &apos;s proposal .
&quot; it was a missed opportunity in 2012 , &quot; continued the former president of Finland .
officially , Russia firmly supported Bashar al @-@ Assad over the four and a half years of war , insisting that its removal may not represent a proposal in any peace agreement .
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him .
Moscow recently began sending troops , tanks and military fly machines in Syria , in an effort to stabil@@ ize the Assad regime and con@@ front the Islamic State extremists .
the Internet live program of Antena 3 will be available for a fee
Antena 3 has informed its viewers on Tuesday that starting November 1 its live program can be watched online for a fee on a monthly subscription basis .
in a &quot; letter to the viewers , &quot; Int@@ act &apos;s news channel said that &quot; we do this with a heavy H@@ art , and we wish you would stay with us in this new phase imposed by market conditions . &quot;

Antena 3 claims that &quot; all these live broadcasts from within the county and abroad , campaigns , everyday news were and are possible due to a consistent financial effort which involved permanent up@@ grad@@ ing and focus on quality . &quot;
we managed to sustain ourselves , given that online and offline retailers have not contributed for the content provided .
the announcement was made although the news television program is available by subscription on Antena Play online platform , where often recordings of Antena &apos;s shows were available .
Marine wild@@ life populations have hal@@ ved in the last 40 years , report finds
the scale of the crisis facing the animals and plants of the sea is documented in detail by the study which claims that marine species around the world , including some that are critical to human food security , are in potentially catastrophic decline .
unprecedented pressures on the global ocean ecosy@@ stem from several directions are combin@@ ing to create a perfect storm of difficulties for virtually everything that lives in the sea , says the WW@@ F &apos;s Liv@@ ing Blue Planet report .
cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s are at serious risk of further decline ( WW@@ F ) S@@ ome marine hab@@ itat@@ s such as man@@ gr@@ oves and se@@ agr@@ asses , on which many other species depend , have seen significant decl@@ ines , while whole populations of comm@@ erc@@ i@@ ally valuable fish , such as mac@@ k@@ ere@@ l and tuna , have pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed by as much as three quarters since the 1970s , the report found .
many cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s , often described as the tropical rain@@ forests of the oce@@ ans because of their rich diversity of life , could be threatened with extinction by mid @-@ Cent@@ ury if ocean ac@@ idity continues to wor@@ sen as a result of rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere - which causes a corresponding rise in car@@ b@@ onic acid in the sea .
&quot; as well as being a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder , healthy seas are the b@@ ed@@ rock of a functioning global economy , &quot; said Lou@@ ise he@@ aps , chief advis@@ or on marine policy at WW@@ F @-@ UK , who helped to comp@@ ile the report .
&quot; by over @-@ exploiting fisheries , degrad@@ ing coastal hab@@ itat@@ s and not addressing global warming , we are so@@ wing the seeds of ecological economic catastrophe , &quot; Dr he@@ aps said .
the report , based on a review of the published scientific literature as well as the Liv@@ ing Planet Index , a database maintained by the zo@@ ological Society of London , is one of the most detailed surve@@ ys of marine wild@@ life ever undertaken .
nearly 20 per cent of total man@@ gr@@ ove area has been lost between 1980 and 2005 ( WW@@ F ) It investigated a wide range of wild@@ life , from fish , marine tur@@ tles and sea cuc@@ um@@ bers - a wor@@ m @-@ like animal with lea@@ ther@@ y skin - to sea plants such as man@@ gr@@ oves and sea gr@@ asses .
the report found that se@@ agr@@ ass coverage has declined by about 30 per cent over the past century while the total area covered by man@@ gr@@ oves has dropped by 20 per cent between 1980 and 2005 , primarily as a result of shr@@ im@@ p farming and other forms of aquaculture .
in the space of a single generation , human activity has severely damaged the ocean by catching fish faster than they can re@@ produce while also destroying their nur@@ series .
profound changes a needed to ensure abund@@ ant ocean life for future generations , &quot; said Marco Lamb@@ er@@ tini , director general of WW@@ F International .
some of the most dramatic decl@@ ines have been in species f@@ ished for commercial gain .
for instance , some 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scr@@ omb@@ id@@ ae family - mac@@ k@@ ere@@ ls , Tun@@ as and sar@@ din@@ es - have fallen by 74 per cent between 1970 and 2010 , with no signs of recovery , the report says .
we are in a race to catch fish that could end with people star@@ ved of a vital food source and an essential economic engine .
over@@ fishing , destruction of marine hab@@ itat@@ s and climate change have dire consequences for the entire human population , with the poorest communities that rely on the sea getting hit fastest and hardest , &quot; Mr Lamb@@ er@@ tini said .
&quot; the collapse of ocean ecosy@@ stems could trigger serious economic decline and undermine our fight to eradic@@ ate poverty and mal@@ nutrition , &quot; he said .
professor K@@ en Nor@@ ris , director of science at the Z@@ L , said : &quot; these devastating figures reveal how quickly human beings are changing the wild@@ life in our oce@@ ans and are a star@@ k warning of the problems we might face as a result . &quot;
Se@@ agr@@ asses : vast under@@ water &quot; me@@ adows &quot; that catch mineral @-@ rich sed@@ iments and stabilise the se@@ ab@@ ed .
coverage has declined by 30 per cent over the past century .
Man@@ gr@@ oves : known to exist in 123 countries , with almost half the coverage in just five nations .
nearly 20 per cent of total man@@ gr@@ ove area has been lost between 1980 and 2005 , mainly due to human enc@@ ro@@ achment .
cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s : some of the most bi@@ olog@@ ically rich and productive hab@@ itat@@ s on earth .
a quarter of all marine species live in or near cor@@ al re@@ ef@@ s yet three quarters of them are currently threatened and many could be lost this century is ocean ac@@ idity continues to wor@@ sen .
deep @-@ sea hab@@ itat@@ s : little is known about the deeper parts of the ocean , but the decline in the number of fish caught in these in@@ accessible locations over the past 40 years suggests they are also being affected by global changes to the sea .
Steven Ger@@ r@@ ard denies racism claims allegedly made by former Liverpool team @-@ m@@ ate El @-@ Had@@ ji Di@@ ou@@ f
in an extract from his upcoming autob@@ io@@ graphy My Story , seri@@ alised by the Daily Mail , Ger@@ r@@ ard criticises the Sen@@ egal@@ ese player for having &quot; no real interest in football &quot; and being the signing he &quot; liked least &quot; during his 17 years at the club .
in re@@ tal@@ iation , Di@@ ou@@ f has been reported to have responded to Ger@@ r@@ ard &apos;s words on Sen@@ egal@@ ese radio station Gr@@ ou@@ pe F@@ ut@@ urs Medias , with translated quot@@ es attributed to the striker stating that &quot; Ger@@ r@@ ard has never liked black people . &quot;
Ger@@ r@@ ard &apos;s lawyers have moved to deny any claims he is racist .
in his latest book , Ger@@ r@@ ard , who has public@@ ised his low opinion of Di@@ ou@@ f before , criticised his former team @-@ m@@ ate &apos;s attitude and professionalism .
&quot; I don &apos;t really want to waste time thinking about El Had@@ ji Di@@ ou@@ f but it &apos;s worth highlighting his wasted seasons at Liverpool as an example of how it can all go wrong , &quot; he writes .
&quot; it seemed to me that Di@@ ou@@ f had no real interest in football and that he cared nothing about Liverpool , &quot; he continued .
for example , the way he sp@@ at a huge glob@@ ule of gun@@ ky ph@@ leg@@ m at a Celtic fan in a UEFA Cup match at Par@@ k@@ head in March 2003 sum@@ med up his cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous and spit@@ eful de@@ mean@@ our .
Di@@ ou@@ f proved to be controversial figure during his time at An@@ field , with his most notorious night coming at Celtic Park .
the Sen@@ egal@@ ese forward was interviewed by police after the spit@@ ting incident and fined two weeks wages by his club , with the £ 60,000 amount being donated to a charity of Celtic &apos;s choice .
in his previous autob@@ io@@ graphy , published in 2007 , Ger@@ r@@ ard described Di@@ ou@@ f as a l@@ azy and self @-@ interested character .
&quot; his attitude was all wrong , &quot; Ger@@ r@@ ard wrote at the time .
I felt he wasn &apos;t really a * * * d about putting his body on the line to get Liverpool back at the top .
Di@@ ou@@ f , who now plays at Malaysian club Sab@@ ah , has also criticised Ger@@ r@@ ard publicly in the past , as well as attacking Ger@@ r@@ ard &apos;s long @-@ standing friend and team @-@ m@@ ate Jamie Car@@ rag@@ her .
in 2012 , Di@@ ou@@ f called Ger@@ r@@ ard &apos; eg@@ ot@@ ist@@ ical &apos; and claimed that nobody at An@@ field likes player who led his side to Champions League victory in 2005 .
Di@@ ou@@ f is also quoted as saying that Ger@@ r@@ ard is &quot; je@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
he said : &quot; Ger@@ r@@ ard is just je@@ al@@ ous of me .
he h@@ asn &apos;t achieved what I have done in football .
when I came to Liverpool , I came up with the status of b@@ oss and he lives there .
I am respected in world football , the greatest football experts have appointed me among the seven best players in the World Cup , the top 100 players of the century .
several big players do not belong .
everywhere I go out of my country , they worship me - while Ger@@ r@@ ard will get abuse whenever he leaves his home city of Liverpool .
from hero to ho@@ ofer : Ale@@ k Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os &apos; spe@@ edy path to &apos; D@@ ancing With the St@@ ars@@ &apos;
Ale@@ k Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os doesn &apos;t just fill the hero@@ ic @-@ man @-@ in @-@ uniform quot@@ ient for this season &apos;s &quot; D@@ ancing With the Stars . &quot;
he &apos;s also a hun@@ ky young , ath@@ letic gu@@ y who &apos;s self @-@ ef@@ facing and ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist@@ y , producers said .
&quot; there are a lot of categories he checks off , and we &apos;re always looking for that of @-@ the @-@ moment booking , &quot; said the ABC show &apos;s co @-@ executive producer , De@@ ena Kat@@ z .
I swe@@ ar he &apos;s going to get an agent out of this .
he &apos;s so ch@@ arm@@ ing .
there &apos;s just something about him .
before he was a contest@@ ant on the hit ho@@ of@@ ing show - but only a few weeks before - Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os made international news for taking action in the face of grave danger .
he and his two childhood friends S@@ pen@@ cer Stone and Anthony Sad@@ ler over@@ powered a gunman armed with an AK @-@ 47 on a packed train from Amsterdam to Paris .
the trio is cred@@ ited with stopping what could have been a mass killing by a suspected terrorist .
Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old Army National Guar@@ d@@ sman who grew up near S@@ acr@@ amen@@ to , has since received a call from President Obama , a Twitter shout @-@ out from Donald Trump and a dinner date with Arnold Schwarz@@ eneg@@ ger , along with decorations from the U.@@ S. military and the French government .
though he might &apos;ve anticipated a few local acc@@ ol@@ ades - there was a parade in the young men &apos;s hon@@ or in S@@ acr@@ amen@@ to on Friday -- he didn &apos;t expect the b@@ read@@ th of well wishes or the &quot; D@@ ancing With the Stars &quot; invitation .
&quot; never in a million years did I think I &apos;@@ d get that offer , &quot; Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os said Saturday during a break in dance practice with his partner , Lind@@ say Arnold .
it &apos;s all brand new and crazy to me .
while he admitted to being &quot; a little nervous &quot; before Monday night &apos;s show , he handled his first fo@@ x@@ tr@@ ot like a professional , earning scores that put him near the top of the competitive h@@ eap .
judges Car@@ rie An@@ n In@@ aba , Bruno Ton@@ i@@ oli and Juli@@ anne H@@ ough said he gave one of the stand@@ out performances of the night .
Kat@@ z and &quot; D@@ W@@ TS &quot; executive producer Ro@@ b W@@ ade said they like to keep a spot open on the show for last @-@ minute contest@@ ants , such as Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os , who have v@@ a@@ ul@@ ted into the public eye .
in this case , Kat@@ z heard about the three American friends on vacation who tack@@ led a shoot@@ er mid @-@ attack on a 500 @-@ passenger train and immediately thought about getting one of them on the dance competition .
she sc@@ oured social media , trac@@ ked down family members and started sending messages to Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os .
when he appeared on &quot; Good Mor@@ ning America &quot; to discuss the incident , during which Stone and several other passengers were injured , Kat@@ z worked with the sister ABC program to cut through the media fi@@ rest@@ or@@ m .
she made her &quot; five @-@ minute elev@@ ator pitch , &quot; and then waited anxi@@ ously to learn if Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os would agree to be on &quot; D@@ W@@ TS . &quot;
&quot; it was touch @-@ and @-@ go there for a while because this is so out of his element , &quot; Kat@@ z said .
he was just serving in Afghanistan not long ago , and now we &apos;re asking if he &apos;s ready to Ch@@ a Ch@@ a .
Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os , who &apos;s taking a short leave from the National Guard , had@@ n &apos;t even watched an entire episode of the show until recently .
he was on the fence about participating , mainly because he didn &apos;t want to be sing@@ led out .
the series co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t accommodate all three friends .
but producers had an ace @-@ in @-@ the @-@ hole : No@@ ah G@@ allow@@ ay , a military v@@ et and double amput@@ ee .
they encouraged Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os to call G@@ allow@@ ay , fan favorite competitor and fin@@ alist from last season , and ask about his experience .
that may have been the tip@@ ping point , along with Kat@@ z &apos;s rel@@ ent@@ less &quot; stal@@ king &quot; and &quot; psych@@ o tex@@ ting , &quot; she said .
&quot; No@@ ah &apos;s a great gu@@ y , and I wanted to know how the military would be por@@ tr@@ ayed and how my friends &quot; images would be protected , &quot; Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os said .
he told me I should do it .
so after that conversation , I said yes .
Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os , an av@@ id spor@@ t@@ sman and history bu@@ ff , has never d@@ anced before , and Arnold has said in interviews that she &apos;s been trying to get him to lo@@ osen his rather stif@@ f military post@@ ure .
but Kat@@ z said she &apos;s confident he will adapt and that viewers will respond to him .
he &apos;ll get so much love in the beginning because people are proud of him and what he &apos;s just done .
&quot; how can you not root for him ? , &quot; Kat@@ z said .
but that &apos;ll only last a few weeks .
he &apos;ll have to dance to keep going .
Sk@@ ar@@ lat@@ os , who &apos;s single and plans eventually to become a police officer , said he &apos;s enjoyed himself so far in the completely un@@ familiar arena .
sched@@ ul@@ ing has been the t@@ ough@@ est battle , with frequent trips to Los Angeles between his media whist@@ le @-@ stop tour and various awards ceremonies .
he &apos;@@ d said in late August , on returning to the U.@@ S. just after the train tak@@ ed@@ own , that he wanted some R &amp; R at home with his family .
&quot; that lasted about a day and a half , &quot; he said .
I think I &apos;ve been home about four days total .
there &apos;s a risk in s@@ nag@@ ging a new@@ s@@ worthy person who isn &apos;t accustomed to being in the spotlight , executive producer W@@ ade said .
and the show wants to make sure the contest@@ ant can do well and have some fun .
&quot; this is a lot of pressure , and we want people to have a good experience , &quot; W@@ ade said .
&quot; we &apos;@@ d never want Ale@@ k to say , &quot; What have I gotten myself into ? &quot;
fingers crossed he has a good time .
the McDonald &apos;s Mc@@ Ri@@ b is back .
for those who wait all year for the pork Pat@@ ty shaped like a mini r@@ ack of r@@ ib@@ s , here &apos;s your chance to go nuts .
but is it harder to find this year ?
CN@@ BC is reporting that only 55 % of the McDonald &apos;s fr@@ anch@@ ises in the country are offering the seasonal special .
last year , 75 % of the restaurants served the Mc@@ Ri@@ b .
&quot; for the 2015 Mc@@ Ri@@ b promotion there are nearly 8,000 participating restaurants , &quot; McDonald &apos;s spokesperson L@@ isa Mc@@ Com@@ b told The Times in an email .
there are a little more than 14,@@ 300 locations of the fast @-@ food restaurant in the U.@@ S .
but according to Mc@@ Com@@ b , it &apos;s the individual fr@@ anch@@ ise owners who decide on serving the Mc@@ Ri@@ b or not .
&quot; this participation isn &apos;t significantly different than last year , &quot; said Mc@@ Com@@ b .
owner / operators are free to offer the menu items they feel their local customers will want .
and if you &apos;re still wondering what a Mc@@ Ri@@ b is , McDonald &apos;s attempted to explain its ingredients last year with a my@@ th@@ bu@@ ster video .
according to the video , the Mc@@ Ri@@ b Pat@@ ty is made with pork , water , de@@ x@@ tr@@ ose and preserv@@ atives .
the sand@@ w@@ ich will be available at participating McDonald &apos;s locations through the end of the year .
there &apos;s also a Mc@@ Ri@@ b Loc@@ ator website ( not affiliated with McDonald &apos;s ) , that can help .
people can report Mc@@ Ri@@ b sigh@@ tings on the website and look for the sand@@ w@@ ich near them .
however , a quick search on the website shows the nea@@ rest Mc@@ Ri@@ b to Los Angeles is in Seb@@ ast@@ opol in S@@ onom@@ a County , spot@@ ted last Saturday by A@@ id@@ an Br@@ igg@@ son@@ ian .
sometimes , I just can &apos;t fight the cr@@ aving for BB@@ Q chicken pizza .
Ke@@ ith Rich@@ ards h@@ ints at new Rolling St@@ ones recordings
Ke@@ ith Rich@@ ards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and documentary feature , but soon the rest of the Rolling St@@ ones might be joining him in the studio .
Rich@@ ards announced that he and the rest of the St@@ ones -- Mic@@ k Jag@@ ger , Charlie Wat@@ ts and Ron@@ nie W@@ ood -- recently met up in London and made , as he put it , &quot; definite plans to record . &quot;
Rich@@ ards was speaking as part of the i@@ He@@ art@@ Radio icons series with inter@@ vie@@ wer Jim Ker@@ r on Tuesday night .
a potential new St@@ ones album would be the group &apos;s first L@@ P since 2005 &apos;s &quot; A B@@ igg@@ er Ban@@ g . &quot;
but the band has been far from id@@ le .
they &apos;ve t@@ oured stadiums exten@@ sively in recent years , and played several small shows around L.@@ A. , including stops at the Ech@@ op@@ lex and F@@ onda Theatre .
at the latter , they re@@ visited their 1971 classic L@@ P &quot; St@@ icky fingers . &quot;
Rich@@ ards has been particularly busy this year , collabor@@ ating on a documentary feature &quot; Ke@@ ith Rich@@ ards : under the In@@ flu@@ ence &quot; scheduled for a S@@ ept . 18 release on Net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
this year he also released a solo album &quot; Cr@@ os@@ se@@ yed Heart , &quot; his third solo ou@@ ting in a five @-@ decade career .
the Times &apos; Rand@@ y Lewis described Rich@@ ards &apos; new album in an early interview with the guitarist : &quot; as always , Rich@@ ards &apos; rag@@ ged voice is an instrument that &apos;s more serv@@ ic@@ eable than distinguished .... &quot;
yet Rich@@ ards gets emotions across in the album &apos;s 15 songs , and that &apos;s always been what rock &apos; n &apos; roll is about .
in the interview , Rich@@ ards said that the band will likely get into the studio after a South American tour early next year .
he didn &apos;t offer other details , but jud@@ ging by their recent shows the band still has plenty of life left in it .
Toronto Film Festival : Jason Bat@@ eman on childhood , adul@@ th@@ ood and &apos; The Family F@@ ang@@ &apos;
Jason Bat@@ eman has already navig@@ ated a few tr@@ icky trans@@ itions in his career with a low @-@ key char@@ m that has made it look far easier than it must have actually been .
once a child actor on such television shows as &quot; Sil@@ ver spo@@ ons , &quot; as an adult he re@@ emerged as a dead@@ pan every@@ man on TV &apos;s &quot; Ar@@ rest@@ ed Development &quot; and in films such as &quot; Hor@@ r@@ ible Bos@@ ses . &quot;
his first film as director was the very ac@@ erb@@ ic comedy &quot; B@@ ad W@@ ords , &quot; in which he also star@@ red .
the film was pic@@ ked up out of the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013 .
Bat@@ eman was back in Toronto earlier this week with his second film as director , the ton@@ ally ambitious &quot; The Family F@@ ang , &quot; an adap@@ tion of Kevin Wilson &apos;s popular 2011 novel with a screen@@ play by Pul@@ it@@ zer Prize winner David Lind@@ say @-@ Ab@@ aire and star@@ ring Nicole K@@ id@@ man alongside Bat@@ eman as troubled si@@ bl@@ ings .
the film is playing the festival looking for U.@@ S. distribution .
many not@@ ices for the book p@@ in@@ ned it as a comedy with deeper emotional curren@@ ts ; the film rec@@ asts the story somewhat by emphas@@ iz@@ ing its dar@@ ker , more dramatic h@@ ef@@ t .
in an interview here Tuesday , Bat@@ eman said he always saw the material as more dramatic than comed@@ ic .
&quot; I never read the book in that way , &quot; he said .
from the book , the subject matter and themes were always very dramatic and very human .
I thought that Kevin was addressing something that was pretty emotional in a very enter@@ taining way .
so that was always the order that I saw things , a drama that had some moments of lev@@ ity and comedy and ec@@ centr@@ icity .
Monday night &apos;s world premiere screening was introduced by the festival &apos;s director of programming , Ker@@ ri Cr@@ ad@@ dock , who expressed particular enthusiasm for Bat@@ eman &apos;s lat@@ e@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s / ear@@ ly@@ - &apos; 9@@ 0s Sit@@ com &quot; The Hog@@ an Family &quot; -- &quot; I haven &apos;t met a lot of &quot; Hog@@ an Family &quot; fans , &quot; Bat@@ eman noted dr@@ y@@ ly when he came on@@ stage .
yet it was direc@@ ting a few episodes of that show that got Bat@@ eman , now 46 , into the Director &apos;s Guil@@ d at the age of 18 .
the story of his new film revol@@ ves around a family with the last name of F@@ ang .
the parents , Cal@@ e@@ b and Cam@@ ille ( Christopher Wal@@ ken and Mar@@ y@@ ann P@@ lun@@ ket@@ t ) , are performance artists of moderate reputation , best known for the way in which they used their children An@@ nie and B@@ ax@@ ter in their pieces , such as st@@ aging a bank robber@@ y over l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop@@ s or being pur@@ pos@@ efully terrible street musicians .
An@@ nie ( K@@ id@@ man ) and B@@ ax@@ ter ( Bat@@ eman ) have subsequently strugg@@ led to find their own ident@@ ities in adul@@ th@@ ood .
An@@ nie is an actress of some notori@@ ety , though as much for her public m@@ elt@@ dow@@ ns as her performances , while B@@ ax@@ ter is a struggling novel@@ ist and magazine journalist .
when Cal@@ e@@ b and Cam@@ ille disappear under mysterious circumstances , An@@ nie and B@@ ax@@ ter are suspicious that this is just another st@@ unt , and they set about trying to discover the truth about their parents and find out some new truths about themselves .
it is perhaps not difficult to see what in that stor@@ y@@ line of child performers moving forward with their adult lives may have spoken directly and deeply to Bat@@ eman .
&quot; my up@@ bringing as a child was very at@@ yp@@ ical , &quot; Bat@@ eman said .
started acting when I was 10 , my parents being my manager , there &apos;s a lot of over@@ lap in this film from the way in which I was brought up .
so this was something I certainly didn &apos;t see as some kind of surface piece of entertainment .
&quot; it &apos;s something I had a full connection to and a deep understanding of , &quot; he added , &quot; and although I didn &apos;t try to drag any of my own personal bag@@ gage into it , I certainly had a clear idea of what a version of this film might look and feel like if it were to represent children who had a non@@ traditional up@@ bringing . &quot;
the project began with K@@ id@@ man , also a producer on the film , acquiring the rights to Wilson &apos;s book .
when Wilson declined to write the adap@@ tion himself , Lind@@ say @-@ Ab@@ aire , who adapted his own &quot; Rab@@ bit H@@ ole , &quot; which K@@ id@@ man star@@ red in , was brought on .
Bat@@ eman , as he says , raised his hand for the chance to direct and Cost@@ ar .
( K@@ id@@ man , currently on@@ stage in London in a production of &quot; photograph 51 , &quot; was not in attendance at Monday &apos;s premiere .
the book &apos;s author was among those in the audience . )
in the Hollywood Report@@ er , David Ro@@ oney called Bat@@ eman &apos;s film a &quot; smart , t@@ art adaptation &quot; that &quot; th@@ umb@@ s its n@@ ose at the cl@@ ich@@ é@@ s of the over @-@ traffic@@ ked d@@ ys@@ functional family gen@@ re to dis@@ s@@ ect the sometimes lifel@@ ong qu@@ est of children to understand their parents in ways that are funny and bit@@ ter@@ sweet , po@@ ign@@ ant and often br@@ ac@@ ingly dark . &quot;
in Vari@@ ety , Justin Ch@@ ang called the film &quot; a sharply drawn portrait &quot; and that Bat@@ eman &quot; shows marked progress and deepening maturity as a film@@ maker with this cl@@ ever@@ ly structured but never ar@@ ch or mechanical adaptation . &quot;
after the film on Monday , as Bat@@ eman and Wal@@ ken stepped on@@ stage for a Q &amp; A , there was a standing ov@@ ation for the much @-@ beloved Wal@@ ken .
of observ@@ ing Bat@@ eman as director and actor , Wal@@ ken said during the Q &amp; A that &quot; I was impressed every day .
I co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t believe it , the ease with which he went back and for@@ th between direc@@ ting the movie , which is a handful , and playing the scenes .
his focus and concentration , really , it &apos;s amazing .
in one dialogue scene in particular , Bat@@ eman stands on a st@@ air@@ case in the family home in the back of the frame , obsc@@ ured in dar@@ k@@ ness , just a shadow in profile , while K@@ id@@ man is closer to the camera and seen more clearly .
it &apos;s not hard to imagine Bat@@ eman the actor debating with Bat@@ eman the director over the fact he can &apos;t be seen .
&quot; direc@@ ting films is incredibly exciting to me , &quot; Bat@@ eman said .
all my decisions come from that place , it &apos;s never to serve me as an actor .
to have the privileged position of being the gu@@ y who is responsible for shaping the entire experience for an audience as opposed to being just one instrument in that orchestra , being an actor , it &apos;s all @-@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing .
regardless of whether that ... actor wants a close @-@ up .
Bat@@ eman said in the Q &amp; A that when he read the script , he immediately thought of Wal@@ ken to play the part of Cal@@ e@@ b , but also that he hoped for composer Carter Bur@@ well for the score .
best known for his long @-@ standing relationship with the Co@@ en brothers , Bur@@ well also scored two other films at the Toronto festival , Charlie Kau@@ f@@ man &apos;s and Du@@ ke Johnson &apos;s stop @-@ motion @-@ anim@@ ation story of love and isolation , &quot; An@@ om@@ al@@ isa , &quot; and Brian Hel@@ g@@ eland &apos;s telling of the 19@@ 6@@ 0s English gang@@ ster tw@@ ins Ron@@ nie and Reg@@ gie Kr@@ ay in &quot; Leg@@ end . &quot;
Bur@@ well composed the score for Tod@@ d Hay@@ nes &quot; upcoming &quot; Carol &quot; as well .
&quot; things that have an obl@@ ong or ob@@ t@@ use tone are very interesting to me , &quot; Bat@@ eman said , expanding on the idea on Tuesday .
navig@@ ating those t@@ ones and deliv@@ ering an audience , hopefully se@@ am@@ less@@ ly , somewhat eleg@@ antly , from one tone to the next throughout the film .
Carter has made a career and an incredible reputation as some@@ body who can navig@@ ate the most complicated of t@@ ones .
both as director and actor , with &quot; The Family F@@ ang , &quot; Bat@@ eman has taken another bold step in a career that is full of self @-@ aware re@@ invention and determination , a mix of comedy and drama , ligh@@ t@@ ness and dark .
as Bat@@ eman said while finishing his introduction to the film at Monday &apos;s world premiere , &quot; It turned out exactly the way I wanted it to , for better or worse . &quot;

major Crime det@@ ectives search house on Bea@@ del@@ l St , Bur@@ ton , where missing man Daniel H@@ ind was last seen
Mr H@@ ind &apos;s sister Chelsea H@@ ind said the wait for information about her missing brother was frustr@@ ating , particularly because police had been given two different accounts of his movements on the night he was last seen .
she said her family had been asking police to search the home since her brother &apos;s disappearance .
&quot; we were hoping they were going to search the house , we w@@ ere@@ n &apos;t told they were going to do it , &quot; she said .
Ms H@@ ind said her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak up and be tru@@ thful with the police .
&quot; we just want to know where Daniel is , and what he did that night , &quot; she said .
there are four of us k@@ ids and quite a few extra family members and about half think he &apos;s alive somewhere and the other half don &apos;t think he is .
either way , we want him home for some closure .
Bulgaria to Ad@@ d 6@@ 35 K@@ m Motor@@ ways by 2022
Bulgaria &apos;s government plans to build 6@@ 35 kilom@@ eters of new motorways and repair 17@@ ,000 of existing main and secondary roads until 2022 .
completing the construction of Hem@@ us , Str@@ uma , Marit@@ sa , Ch@@ ern@@ o M@@ ore and Kal@@ ot@@ ina motorways , all of them parts of pan @-@ European transport cor@@ rid@@ ors , is among the priorities in a road infrastructure development plan approved by the government on Wednesday .
the plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network as well as ensure high road safety and efficient management of road transport , the government said in a statement .
Bulgaria Is Trans@@ it Country for Trafficking in Cultural Goo@@ ds from Syria
Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of stolen cultural goods from the Middle East due to its key geograph@@ ic location , according to Interior Minister Rum@@ y@@ ana Bach@@ var@@ ova .
speaking Wednesday at a conference on the fight against lo@@ oting of Syria &apos;s cultural heritage , Bach@@ var@@ ova reminded that Bulgaria &apos;s national legislation had been adjusted to the new circumstances , featuring an emphasis on the ban on cross @-@ border trade from Syria and Iraq .
Bach@@ var@@ ova , as cited by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency ( B@@ TA ) , stated that the efforts of the competent units of the Interior Ministry and most of all the Chief Directorate &quot; Combating Organiz@@ ed Crime &quot; ( G@@ D@@ BO@@ P ) were focused on preventing the illegal smuggling and sale of Bulgarian cultural objects .
she declared that Bulgaria was a country with a rich history , with recent surve@@ ys placing it third , after Italy and Greece , by trafficking of cultural goods and objects .
Bulgaria &apos;s Interior Minister said that the trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites located in zones such as Iraq and Syria was a phenomenon that was gaining momentum and was described as an exceptionally serious war crime .
she insisted that concerted and decis@@ i@@ ove actions were necessary to stop the ongoing deliberate destruction of history .
UNESCO Director General Irina Bo@@ kova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria showed that the country was plag@@ u@@ ed by industrial scale lo@@ oting .
the participants in Wednesday &apos;s conference agreed that Syria &apos;s cultural heritage was seriously endangered and that the international community had to unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war @-@ torn country .
A@@ ero@@ jet Rock@@ et@@ dy@@ ne says new AR @-@ 1 engine timetable could sli@@ p
A@@ ero@@ jet Rock@@ et@@ dy@@ ne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR @-@ 1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon @-@ to @-@ be banned Russian engine , but the date could sli@@ p if it does not receive enough U.@@ S. government funding .
A@@ ero@@ jet Vice President Jul@@ ie Van Kle@@ eck declined comment on reports that A@@ ero@@ jet has offered $ 2 billion to acquire United La@@ unch Alliance ( U@@ LA ) , a 50 @-@ 50 rocket launch venture of L@@ ock@@ he@@ ed Martin Cor@@ p and Boeing Co .
analysts say the bid is a strategic move by A@@ ero@@ jet to shut out rival Blue Or@@ ig@@ in , a company owned by Ama@@ zon@@ .com founder Jeff B@@ ez@@ os , that is developing a new engine fav@@ ored by U@@ LA for use in its new Vul@@ can rocket .
ula has said Blue Or@@ ig@@ in &apos;s engine program is about two years ahead of A@@ ero@@ jet &apos;s work on the AR @-@ 1 engine , a claim A@@ ero@@ jet disputes .
work on the new engines gained urgency after U.@@ S. lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD @-@ 180 engines for launches of U.@@ S. military or spy satel@@ lit@@ es following Russia &apos;s annex@@ ation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year .
van Kle@@ eck said the company was testing hard@@ ware for the engine , which is being designed with 3D @-@ printed parts to fit into both U@@ LA &apos;s Atl@@ as 5 rocket , now powered by the RD @-@ 180 engine , and the new Vul@@ can rocket that U@@ LA is developing at a cost of about $ 1 billion .
A@@ ero@@ jet says it would be less costly and risky to integrate its engine into the Atl@@ as 5 rocket than to develop a wh@@ ol@@ ly new engine and rocket , as U@@ LA currently plans .
van Kle@@ eck said A@@ ero@@ jet planned to begin testing full scale engines in 2017 , followed by certification in 2019 , but the date could sli@@ p if the company did not receive enough funding from the Air Force in contract awards expected late in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 , which begins Oc@@ t .
she said the company was eager to see how the Air Force split funding of about $ 160 million among rival bidders .
she said A@@ ero@@ jet was also expl@@ oring other private funding options for the engine but gave no details .
the Air Force competition is a public @-@ private partnership , with each of the bidders asked to provide one @-@ third of the funding , with the Air Force to provide a two @-@ thirds share .
space Ex@@ pl@@ oration Technologies , or Sp@@ ace@@ X , and Blue Or@@ ig@@ in , both of which are priv@@ ately held , have self @-@ funded their engine work , and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding .
Bre@@ wer A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v seeks $ 275 billion tie @-@ up with SA@@ B@@ Miller
An@@ he@@ user @-@ Bus@@ ch In@@ Be@@ v ( AB@@ I.@@ B@@ R ) , the world &apos;s largest bre@@ wer , has approached rival SA@@ B@@ Miller ( SA@@ B.@@ L ) about a takeover that would form a colos@@ sus producing a third of the world &apos;s beer .
a merg@@ ed group would have a market value of around $ 275 billion at current prices , and would combine A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v &apos;s domin@@ ance of Latin America with SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s of Africa , both fast @-@ growing markets , as well as their bre@@ w@@ eries in Asia .
&quot; the real attraction is Africa , where A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v has no presence , as well as some add @-@ ons in Asia and Latin America , &quot; said Societe Generale analyst Andrew Hol@@ land .
ab In@@ Be@@ v and other top bre@@ w@@ ers are trying to move into new markets as they look to sh@@ ru@@ g off weakness in North America and Europe , where consumers increasingly choose craft be@@ ers made by independent players or wine or spir@@ its .
SA@@ B@@ Miller , the world number two and maker of more than 200 be@@ ers including Per@@ oni , Gr@@ ol@@ sch and Pil@@ s@@ ner Ur@@ qu@@ ell , said on Wednesday it had been informed that A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oc@@ t . 14 under British rules .
ab In@@ Be@@ v , controlled by 3@@ G Capital , a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors , confirmed its approach .
3@@ G , known for its focus on cost cuts at the expense of marketing , has previously orchest@@ rated tak@@ e@@ ov@@ ers of Burg@@ er King , ket@@ ch@@ up maker Hein@@ z ( K@@ H@@ C.@@ O ) and Kr@@ aft F@@ oo@@ ds .
a source close to SA@@ B said it was too early to say what it would do since no offer has been made .
&quot; at this stage , we &apos;re in wait and see mode , &quot; said the source .
speculation about a merger , likely to raise ant@@ itr@@ ust concerns in markets such as the United States and China , has sw@@ ir@@ led for years .
the timing of the approach , after more than a decade of acquis@@ itions by A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v , follows a r@@ oughly 15 per@@ cent drop in SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s share price since August .
&quot; it &apos;s exactly the moment they &apos;ve been waiting for , &quot; said Mor@@ n@@ ing@@ star analyst Phil Gor@@ ham .
it makes sense financially for the first time in years .
ab In@@ Be@@ v will have to pay at least 40 pounds ( $ 62 ) per SA@@ B Miller share , and maybe as much as 45 pounds , according to analysts - impl@@ ying an overall price of up to $ 130 billion , including SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s debt .
that would make it the biggest M &amp; A deal of 2015 , already shaping up to be a record year since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of deal volume , and one the five largest tak@@ e@@ ov@@ ers since 1980 .
shares in SA@@ B closed up 19.@@ 9 per@@ cent at 36.@@ 14 pounds , giving it a market capit@@ aliz@@ ation of $ 90 billion .
ab In@@ Be@@ v &apos;s were up 6.@@ 4 per@@ cent .
rivals He@@ ine@@ ken ( H@@ E@@ IN@@ .@@ AS ) , Car@@ l@@ s@@ berg ( CAR@@ L@@ b@@ .@@ CO ) and Di@@ ag@@ eo ( DG@@ E.@@ L ) also rose on speculation SA@@ B might seek another merger as a defence strategy , as it did last year when it offered to buy He@@ ine@@ ken , but was re@@ buf@@ fed .
since then it has combined its African soft drink bot@@ t@@ ler with that of Coca @-@ Cola ( K@@ O.@@ N ) , and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combin@@ ing with Di@@ ag@@ eo or Australian drinks firm Coca @-@ Cola Am@@ ati@@ l ( C@@ CL@@ .@@ A@@ X ) .
the global beer market share of A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v , maker of Bud@@ we@@ iser , Stel@@ la Ar@@ to@@ is and Cor@@ ona , was 21.@@ 1 per@@ cent in 2014 , while SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s was 15 per@@ cent , according to industry experts Plat@@ o Log@@ ic .
ab In@@ Be@@ v &apos;s target for its net debt to core profit ( E@@ B@@ IT@@ DA ) ratio is 2 times , from around 2.5 currently .
it is likely to reach that by 2016 , the earliest any deal could realist@@ ically be completed , and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover .
when it bought Bud@@ we@@ iser @-@ maker An@@ he@@ user @-@ Bus@@ ch in 2008 for $ 52 billion , the largest cash takeover in history at the time , it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times .
going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $ 100 billion in debt .
ab In@@ Be@@ v &apos;s controlling families own just over half of the company , while SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s two top shareholders are cigarette maker Al@@ tr@@ ia ( M@@ O.@@ N ) and the San@@ to Dom@@ ingo family of Colombia .
Al@@ tr@@ ia on Wednesday declined comment on the A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v approach , but on S@@ ept . 9 , its C@@ FO Bil@@ ly G@@ if@@ ford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evalu@@ ates its SA@@ B@@ Miller investment &quot; and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders &apos; best interests . &quot;
the San@@ to Dom@@ ingo family could not immediately be reached for comment .
Neil D@@ w@@ ane , European chief investment officer , equity , at Allianz Global Invest@@ ors , which holds shares in both companies , said A@@ B In@@ Be@@ v had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders .
Ab@@ i is paying a high price but ac@@ cre@@ tion to ear@@ nings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 per@@ cent .
however , we think the return on this deal could be a relatively disappointing 8 per@@ cent after 10 years , &quot; D@@ w@@ ane said .
there are significant ant@@ itr@@ ust hurdles to any combination , particularly in the United States , where the companies would have about 70 per@@ cent of the beer market .
&quot; the costs that could be saved in the distribution operations are high - and the ant@@ itr@@ ust hurdles are higher , &quot; said Eri@@ k Gordon , professor at the University of Mich@@ igan &apos;s Ross School of Business .
a deal would allow Mol@@ son Co@@ ors to acquire the 58 per@@ cent of the joint venture owned by SA@@ B@@ Miller according to the operating agreement that govern@@ s it .
a change in control at SA@@ B@@ Miller would automatically give Mol@@ son the right to acquire an additional 8 per@@ cent and name a new CEO at the venture .
Den@@ ver @-@ based Mol@@ son would also have the right of first and last offer for the remaining 50 per@@ cent stake .
a Mol@@ son spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in a bid , but Mol@@ son shares sur@@ ged more than 12 per@@ cent to an all @-@ time high .
any merg@@ ed group may also have to sell interests in China , where SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s CR S@@ now joint venture with China Resources ( 0@@ 29@@ 1.@@ H@@ K ) is the market leader .
He@@ ine@@ ken , Car@@ l@@ s@@ berg or China &apos;s T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o could be potential buyers .
Plat@@ o estimates that after dispos@@ als , the combined group could end up with a 28 per@@ cent global market share .
ab In@@ Be@@ v is being advised by Laz@@ ard , while SA@@ B@@ Miller is being advised by Ro@@ be@@ y War@@ sh@@ aw , J@@ P Morgan and Morgan Stan@@ ley .
Pakistani police accuse former air force pilot of helping al Qaeda
Pakistani police have arrested a former Air Force pilot who later donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda , police told Reuters on Wednesday , in a rare case targeting those who financially contribute to milit@@ ancy .
the suspect , Sy@@ ed She@@ aba Ahmed , was detained in the southern city of Kar@@ achi .
he paid for the treatment of injured Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of L@@ ah@@ ore , police said .
he also influenced two militants involved in an attack on a bus@@ load of minority Sh@@ i &apos;@@ ite Is@@ ma@@ ili Muslims in May that killed 45 people , senior police officer Nav@@ e@@ ed K@@ ha@@ w@@ aja from the provincial Coun@@ ter Terrorism Department told journalists .
he will be charged with terror financing , said K@@ ha@@ w@@ aja .
&quot; Ahmed has also been financing Afghan Taliban , we are still in the process of as@@ certain@@ ing if he has been providing financing through his businesses or someone else is behind him , &quot; the officer said .
&quot; Ahmed was also providing financial assistance to A@@ Q@@ IS , &quot; K@@ ha@@ w@@ aja said , referring to Al Qaeda in the Indian sub@@ continent , a branch of Al Qaeda that was founded a year ago .
the arrest is a rare success for Pakistan &apos;s police force , struggling with milit@@ ancy and corruption as well as crime .
after Taliban gunmen massac@@ red around 150 people , mostly children , at an army @-@ run school in December , the government vowed to crack down on milit@@ ancy .
attacks have fallen sharply as the military has also pushed further into the law@@ less trib@@ al regions bord@@ ering Afghanistan .
but militant groups remain a threat , and many have followers in Pakistan &apos;s cities , which fall under the control of the chron@@ ically under @-@ trained and under @-@ funded police force .
Ahmed , 52 , used to give ser@@ m@@ ons at a mosque in Kar@@ achi &apos;s up@@ scale Def@@ en@@ se H@@ ous@@ ing Authority neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
his public ser@@ m@@ ons were moderate , but priv@@ ately he encouraged radic@@ alism , police said .
he previously studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in S@@ arg@@ od@@ ha city , and left the Pakistani Air Force in 1998 , another security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity .
he later went into the paint and chemicals business .
rap@@ per R@@ ick Ross loses &apos; Ever@@ y@@ day I &apos;m h@@ ust@@ lin &quot; copyright claim
new Y@@ OR@@ K rap@@ per R@@ ick Ross cannot copyright the words &quot; Ever@@ y@@ day I &apos;m h@@ ust@@ lin &apos; , &quot; a U.@@ S. judge has ruled , putting an end to his claim against music group L@@ M@@ FA@@ O for selling T @-@ shirts with the similar catch @-@ phrase &quot; Ever@@ y@@ day I &apos;m sh@@ uf@@ fl@@ in &apos; . &quot;
in a ruling released on Tuesday in Miami federal court , U.@@ S. District Judge Kath@@ le@@ en Williams said Ross &apos;s slogan , a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit &quot; H@@ ust@@ lin &apos; , &quot; is a short expression that courts have repeatedly said cannot be copy@@ r@@ ighted .
Williams &apos; order puts a d@@ ent in a copyright infringement law@@ suit that Ross , whose real name is William Leonard Rober@@ ts II , filed against L@@ M@@ FA@@ O in 2013 .
Ross alleged the Los Angeles @-@ based electr@@ op@@ op duo , made up of Stefan Gord@@ y and Sk@@ yl@@ er Gord@@ y , copied &quot; H@@ ust@@ lin &apos; &quot; for their own 2010 ch@@ art @-@ top@@ ping &quot; Party Rock An@@ them , &quot; which contains the lyr@@ ic &quot; Ever@@ y@@ day I &apos;m sh@@ uf@@ fl@@ in &apos; . &quot;
the hip hop star said L@@ M@@ FA@@ O &apos;s song was &quot; an obvious attempt to capit@@ aliz@@ e on the f@@ ame and success of H@@ ust@@ lin &apos; . &quot;
he also sued K@@ ia Motors for using &quot; Party Rock An@@ them &quot; in an advertising campaign .
in the complaint , Ross claimed L@@ M@@ FA@@ O violated his copyright by selling T @-@ shirts and other mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise bearing the sh@@ uf@@ fl@@ in &apos; slogan .
in her order on Tuesday , Williams said that &quot; H@@ ust@@ lin &apos; , &quot; as a song , is protected by copyright .
but Ross &apos; three @-@ word slogan , is made up of ordinary words and cannot be copy@@ r@@ ighted , she said .
the judge compared it to other music catch @-@ ph@@ ras@@ es from the past , such as &quot; you got the right one , U@@ H @-@ hu@@ h , &quot; &quot; Hol@@ la back , &quot; and &quot; we get it pop@@ pin &apos; , &quot; saying it is a &quot; short expression of the sort that courts have uniform@@ ly held unc@@ op@@ y@@ r@@ igh@@ table . &quot;

Dr . Carson closing on Trump in latest G@@ O@@ P presidential poll
political nov@@ ice Ben Carson is gaining on bomb@@ astic fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner Donald Trump among Republican primary voters , according to the latest 2016 presidential race poll .
Carson has gained 17 points since last month , while Jeb Bush has fallen by seven points .
following Trump &apos;s 27 @-@ per@@ cent support in the latest C@@ BS / New York Times poll , Carson , a retired neur@@ os@@ urg@@ eon , comes in at second with 23 per@@ cent , followed by Bush , television personality Mike H@@ uck@@ ab@@ ee , and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , each at six per@@ cent .
support among Republican primary voters rose from early August to early September for Trump , Carson , Ohio Governor John Kas@@ ich , and former He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard executive Car@@ ly F@@ ior@@ ina .
support for the latter two remains in the single dig@@ its , though .
Jeb Bush , the former Florida Governor and latest Bush family standard @-@ bea@@ rer , dropped seven percentage points in a month , while Wis@@ cons@@ in Governor Scott Walker fell eight points .
Walker has two @-@ per@@ cent support in the latest poll .
Carson pulled in more support from college graduates than Trump ( 29 per@@ cent to 21 per@@ cent ) , while Trump led Carson in voters without a college degree ( 30 per@@ cent to 19 per@@ cent ) .
men were more likely than women to support Trump , while women were more likely than men to go for Ru@@ bio .
thir@@ ty @-@ seven per@@ cent of poll respondents said their mind was made up as to which candidate they will support in their respective state &apos;s primary vote .
those who said they knew who they will vote for were twice as likely to support Trump as opposed to Carson .
it is too early to tell for 63 per@@ cent of Republican primary voters .
further results from the C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T poll , conducted from September 9 to 13 , will be released later Tuesday ahead of a Republican presidential debate .
Carson &apos;s rise in this poll mirr@@ ors the ascen@@ sion of under@@ dog Ver@@ mon@@ t Senator Bern@@ ie Sanders over long@@ time fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner for the Democratic presidential nomination , former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
the latest C@@ BS presidential nomination trac@@ ker has Sanders up by 10 points and 22 points in I@@ ow@@ a and New H@@ amp@@ shire , respectively , among likely Democratic primary voters .
ban sex robots , says leading eth@@ ic@@ ist
a leading robot eth@@ ic@@ ist has launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots .
Dr Kath@@ le@@ en Rich@@ ard@@ son , a robot@@ ics expert at De Mont@@ fort University in Leicester , England , warns that sex robots could contribute to the systemic de@@ human@@ iz@@ ation of women and children .
&quot; sex robots seem to be a growing focus in the robot@@ ics industry and the models that they draw on - how they will look , what roles they would play - are very disturbing indeed , &quot; she told the BBC .
Rich@@ ard@@ son explained that her Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst S@@ ex Rob@@ ots is not anti @-@ sex , but rather anti @-@ exploitation .
technology is not neutral .
it &apos;s informed by class , race and gender .
political power inform@@ s the development of technology , &quot; she told the Washington Post .
that &apos;s why we can do something about it .
these robots will contribute to more sexual exploitation .
though the sex @-@ bot@@ s currently being manufactured are still relatively prim@@ itive , Rich@@ ard@@ son is worried they are the first step to something more sin@@ ister .
it &apos;s a new and emerging technology , but let &apos;s n@@ ip in the bu@@ d .
the industry certainly appears to be pic@@ king up st@@ eam .
the sex dol@@ l company True compan@@ ion launched Rox@@ x@@ x@@ y , the &quot; world &apos;s first sex robot , &quot; several years ago .
however , anx@@ ie@@ ties over AI &apos;s potential dangers are not un@@ common , even among industry b@@ ig@@ w@@ ig@@ s .
just this spring , Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk wrote of the &quot; the risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five @-@ year time@@ frame .
theoretical physicist and cosm@@ ologist Stephen Hawking , warned &quot; the development of full artificial intelligence could sp@@ ell the end of the human race , &quot; in an interview with the BBC last December .
Britain to welcome first Syrian refugees - RT UK
Britain will accept its first refugees fleeing the Syrian war in the next few days , Home Secretary Th@@ ere@@ sa May has announced .
they will be cared for under the government &apos;s expanded resettlement program .
refugees seeking asylum will arrive from camps which border the war @-@ torn country .
they are the first of the 20,000 refugees the UK plans to take by 2020 .
speaking in the House of Comm@@ ons , the home secretary said the government is &quot; working at speed &quot; to secure more arrivals .
in welcoming vulnerable refugees to the UK it is imperative that we have in place the support and help that they need and deserve .
I know that honor@@ able members and the general public are keen to know more detail on the numbers and when people are expected to arrive .
may said the government needed to make further plans to ensure the refugees had adequate provisions when they arrive .
I must underline that the scale of the expansion needs careful and met@@ icul@@ ous planning to ensure we get it right .
I and the Minister for Syrian refugees Richard Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton will continue to update the House on that point .
but I am pleased to tell the House that we are looking forward to welcoming the first wave of new arrivals in the coming days and are working at speed to plan for even more in the coming weeks .
prime Minister David Cameron drew the ire of MPs and campaig@@ ners when he unveiled the government &apos;s refugee plan , with many saying the figure was too low .
Cameron told the House of Comm@@ ons earlier in September that the UK would &quot; live up to its moral responsibility &quot; and take in 20,000 refugees from camps in the Middle East by the next general election .
he added that refugees would not automatically be given full asylum , but instead a humanitarian status which would allow them to apply for asylum after five years .
but critics noted that the figures amounted to only 12 refugees a day , with former Liberal Democrat MP Paddy Ashdown saying the measures were &quot; der@@ is@@ ory . &quot;
Ashdown further revealed that children taken in by the scheme would be deport@@ ed when they turned 18 if they are not granted asylum .
celebrities and high @-@ profile public figures also came together to condemn the measures .
in a signed letter , big names including Benedict Cum@@ ber@@ bat@@ ch , Colin Fir@@ th , Jamie Oliver and Ke@@ ira K@@ night@@ ley said the response to the crisis was &quot; too little , too late . &quot;
&quot; a responsibility that should be shared with our European neigh@@ b@@ ors and not simply shoul@@ dered by the countries closest to the turbul@@ ence driving people from their homes , &quot; they wrote .
ru@@ ble rallies amid global uncertainty - RT Business
the Russian ru@@ ble strengthened on Wednesday , trading at 6@@ 5.@@ 66 to the US dollar and 7@@ 3.@@ 98 to the euro on the Moscow Stock Exchange as of 10 : 00 GMT .
overall , the Russian currency has gained seven per@@ cent since its lowest rate of 71 ru@@ bles against the green@@ back on August 24 .
analysts say the ru@@ ble &apos;s re@@ bound is on the back of investor reaction to current global market turmoil caused by struggling China , the US Federal Reserve &apos;s possible interest rate hi@@ ke and over@@ reaction to cheap oil .
B@@ rent fut@@ ures were up 61 c@@ ents Wednesday at $ 48.@@ 36 per barrel .
West Texas intermedi@@ ate ( W@@ TI ) was trading 72 c@@ ents up at $ 45.@@ 31 a barrel .

experts also point to another factor for the Russian currency &apos;s sur@@ ge .

NASA and the UK work together on drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and companies like Google , Amazon and telec@@ oms company Ver@@ izon on developing a database which will allow drone pilots to reserve blocks of airspace for flights .
there is nothing yet in place at the EU level .
the collaboration comes as a result of widespread anxiety about the possibility of a mid @-@ air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft .
a new For@@ rest@@ er report v@@ iv@@ id@@ ly described the potential fall@@ out .
&quot; imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of businesses deliv@@ ering products or captur@@ ing data in den@@ se urban areas like New York City , Chicago , or San Francisco , &quot; the research says .
without a common set of technology protoc@@ ols and rules of the air , chaos could re@@ ign .
according to D@@ etta O &apos;@@ Cath@@ ain , a Baroness in the House of L@@ ords , the concern has escal@@ ated in the wake of reports of near mis@@ ses , and the operation of drones over football stadiums and close to nuclear power stations , and the E@@ if@@ fel Tower .
&quot; more than 400 calls made to the Metropolitan police were regarding incidents involving drones over the last two years , &quot; O &apos;@@ Cath@@ ain said .
the big idea : to build a system to track and trace all drones , especially those flying below 500 feet , ir@@ respective of whether they were flown by commercial or le@@ is@@ ure pilots .
&quot; as more small drones are flown comm@@ erc@@ i@@ ally at low altitude beyond the sight of the pilot , or even flown completely autonom@@ ously , some sort of air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights will be required to ensure the safety of complex operations , for example , package delivery in cities , &quot; she said .
according to N@@ asa , this drone traffic management system will incorporate services such as airspace design , severe weather and wind avo@@ idance , congestion management , route planning and re @-@ rou@@ ting - similar to the rules in place for road traffic , such as signals and lanes .
they expect to have a working prototype by 2019 .
the drone industry is set to explode in the European Union over the coming years .
&quot; we are already seeing small , innovative UK SME companies using this technology to great effect in the energy sector , agriculture and media industries , &quot; Lord T@@ ari@@ q said .
more than 6@@ 70 per@@ missions for commercial drone operations in the UK alone were granted by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014 .
the European Commission estimated that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050 .
dis@@ like button : why Facebook wants to know what makes you sad
&quot; a Look B@@ ack &quot; is similar ; comp@@ iling your highlights and key moments ( on Facebook ) .
but what will it mean for those thr@@ ong@@ ing mult@@ itudes within Facebook &apos;s virtual borders that now out@@ number any country ?
an emp@@ ath@@ y button will , first , of course , allow Facebook to understand you better .
Facebook &apos;s enormous value - around $ 240 billion at last count - is due to the un@@ thin@@ k@@ ably large mo@@ und of consumer data that it sits on .
every interaction , post , like and friend you make is put together to build a remark@@ ably rich , and constantly updating picture of who you are , and what you &apos;re interested in .
this is predominantly of value to advertis@@ ers , who can use all of this information to carefully sculp@@ t who sees their adver@@ ts on Facebook to those they judge to be most interested in them .
an emp@@ ath@@ y button adds another layer of data , and certainly opens the door to other kinds of advertis@@ ers to use that platform .
whilst a sports company goes after those who &quot; like &quot; a national football team , char@@ ities and campaig@@ ners will certainly wish to target those who &quot; emp@@ ath@@ ise &quot; with the refugee crisis , for instance .
it will also probably change what you see on your News Fe@@ ed .
Facebook uses incredibly clever and sophisticated alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms to win@@ now down all the enormous universe of content that you could see , into the much smaller feed of what you do actually see .
this alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m cruci@@ ally depends on what you &apos;ve found interesting in the past , and especially what you &apos;ve liked .
there is , no doubt , a fear within Facebook that l@@ ots of meaning@@ ful but unhappy posts are missing the alg@@ ori@@ th@@ mic cut because people don &apos;t feel comfortable li@@ king them .
however , if Facebook understand more about what you find up@@ setting or un@@ set@@ tling , they could also take a decision to take these kinds of posts out of the News Fe@@ ed .
Facebook has previously conducted experiments to understand how what you see in your News Fe@@ ed affects your emotional state , and especially how this transfers from person to person .
academ@@ ics call this &quot; emotional contag@@ ion &quot; and although it sounds sp@@ oo@@ ky , it was probably simply an attempt by Facebook ( and openly published with their consent ) to understand better how their platform works and whether they can tw@@ eak alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms to share more stuf@@ f .
whatever happens to the emp@@ ath@@ y button , it will be Facebook &apos;s decision .
the truly striking thing is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to their service can cause so much bub@@ bling speculation .
the reason it can is because the decisions that Facebook makes - whether involving the visible but@@ t@@ ons we see , or the invisible alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms working away und@@ ern@@ e@@ ath - now have profound consequences over us .
we now live meaning@@ ful parts of our lives in the digital world , and go there to find everything from love to comfort , to a new job .
on the other hand , Facebook is a company , and one that is fighting a constant struggle for survival within the fi@@ erc@@ ely Dar@@ win@@ ian world of technology and social media .
the decisions they make - new but@@ t@@ ons included - will be those they judge to stay af@@ lo@@ at in this race .
I think many people can emp@@ ath@@ ise with that ; and soon they &apos;ll have a button to do so .
biometric wr@@ ist@@ bands predict out@@ bur@@ sts in people with autism
through ten years of research in America , Dr Good@@ win and his team have established that body signals may be able to predict these sometimes violent changes before they happen , giving care@@ rs the opportunity to take appropriate action .
the au@@ ti@@ st@@ ic children we &apos;re working with can &apos;t tell us what &apos;s going on .
they can &apos;t say they have a head@@ ache , or &apos; it &apos;s too loud in here &apos; or &apos; I don &apos;t like this teacher &apos; , &quot; he said .
if we want to understand them , we need to look at what their body is telling us - and we need to do this in a gent@@ le , un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive way .
for instance , a simple vis@@ u@@ alisation of colours in an ap@@ p could den@@ ote the level of ag@@ itation - red could be used as a warning of behav@@ io@@ ural change , and blue could be used to den@@ ote under @-@ ar@@ ous@@ al , allowing a care@@ r to understand when the person is bo@@ red and lacking stimul@@ ation .
data from the wr@@ ist@@ bands could also be collected over time and saved on a secure serv@@ er , allowing care@@ rs to understand the bigger picture of how the person responds to different situations , and to understand what interventions work best .
I need to be clear that we are not reading minds .
bio sensors aren &apos;t magic - they still need a human to interpret them .
he added that his team would be working with manufacturers to further develop this technology so that it can be autism @-@ specific .
the research has been welcomed by Jane car@@ olan , director of client services at W@@ ir@@ ral au@@ ti@@ st@@ ic Society , which will be show@@ cas@@ ing the technology at its Aut@@ ech 2015 conference on autism and technology in Manchester on 1 October .
when you work with people with severe autism , as we do , you see the dramatic difference that assist@@ ive technology can make to their quality of li@@ fe@@ . iPad Ap@@ ps are now , liter@@ ally , giving a voice to people who have never spoken .
robots are helping au@@ ti@@ st@@ ic children learn to play pe@@ ek @-@ a @-@ bo@@ o .
&quot; who knows where this innovation may lead us , &quot; she said .
Assist@@ ive technologies can be truly life @-@ changing and we feel it is part of our mission as an autism charity to ensure everyone has access this information and is part of the debate about how we want to support people with autism in the future .
France to target Is@@ is in Syria &apos; in coming week@@ s@@ &apos;
French war@@ planes will launch air strikes against Is@@ is targets in Syria in the coming weeks , the government announced on Wednesday , just days after President François Hollande said the intervention was &quot; necessary . &quot;
France will carry out its first air strikes on the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria &quot; in the coming weeks , &quot; Defence Minister Jean @-@ Yves Le Drian said Wednesday .
the French air force has been carrying out re@@ conn@@ aissance missions over Syria since September 8 , and strikes will follow &quot; in the coming weeks , as soon as we have clearly identified targets , &quot; Le Drian told France Inter radio .
on Tuesday , Le Drian told parliament the Islamic State had made &quot; very significant progress &quot; in Syria , especially in the northern region of Al@@ ep@@ po .
&quot; there is an extremely strong offensive taking place on the small town of Marea , which if it succeeded would wi@@ pe out what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the national Syrian coalition , or what is left of it , &quot; he said .
France has been part of a US @-@ led coalition bombing Is@@ is positions in Iraq for the past year , but Hollande changed strategy last week to expand action to Syria as political pressure moun@@ ts over the jihadist threat faced by France .
the United States , Canada , Turkey and Gulf states have already been involved in strikes on Is@@ is militants in Syria .
iOS 9 Ad Bloc@@ king Fe@@ ature Will M@@ ake Your Phone Way F@@ aster
the newest version of iOS 9 launches Wednesday packed with a b@@ ev@@ y of new features .
one of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online publishers - will be the ability to easily block ads while sur@@ f@@ ing the web .
the new function@@ ality will allow users to download third @-@ party exten@@ sions that block cookies , banner ads , pop @-@ ups and other types of advertisements while using Apple &apos;s mobile saf@@ ari brow@@ ser .
in tests ad @-@ bloc@@ kers have been shown to load news sites like the New York Times up to twice as fast , according to Reuters .
they also help users con@@ serve data usage and bat@@ tery life .
users will have multiple ad @-@ blocking options , including the Ap@@ ps 1@@ Bloc@@ ker , Bloc@@ k@@ r and Cr@@ ystal .
Ad@@ Block Plus , a popular ad @-@ blocking tool on des@@ k@@ t@@ ops , has also released its own iOS web brow@@ ser that limits ads ; its maker has plans to release a saf@@ ari extension in the future .
people using ad @-@ blocking software are likely to run into a few hit@@ ches .
advertising still shows up within Ap@@ ps ( which is where Apple makes its money on iOS ) .
a growing number of media sites , including Hul@@ u and The Washington Post , are also attempting to stop people visiting their site from using ad bloc@@ kers .
still , the use of ad bloc@@ kers on des@@ k@@ top computers rose about 48 % last year .
their rise presents big challenges for online media , which has largely been offered to customers for free and financially supported by advertising for decades .
one report says ad blocking could cost online publishers almost $ 22 billion in ad revenue this year alone .
to enable ad blocking in iOS 9 , users must download an ad @-@ blocking ap@@ p , then go to set@@ tings - &gt; saf@@ ari - &gt; Con@@ tent bloc@@ kers to enable a content @-@ blocking extension .
Obama talks terrorism , migrant crisis with Spanish king
President Barack Obama welcomed King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House Tuesday , where the pair discussed a wide range of topics -- but perhaps nothing more than the importance of international cooperation .
Obama and the king addressed the fight against the Islamic State as well as the growing migrant crisis in Europe -- which has already seen hundreds of thousands escape their homeland for the West .
&quot; Spain has worked hard to deal with this issue in the past with North African migrants that of@@ ten@@ times are engaged in very dangerous trav@@ els , and human trafficking that takes place , &quot; Obama said .
obviously , that &apos;s gotten worse over the last several months .
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation , particularly as the Spanish territory of Catalonia is set to vote in elections later this month .
&quot; as a matter of foreign policy , we are deeply committed to maintaining a relationship with a strong and unified Spain , &quot; Obama said .
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief also told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country some@@ time before he leaves office in 2017 .
&quot; we welcome you with open arms , &quot; Felipe replied .
first lady Michelle Obama took the queen on a tour of the White House grounds and talked over tea .
it was the royal couple &apos;s first visit to the United States since assuming the throne .
after leaving Washington , they were scheduled to visit South Florida .

Arctic mos@@ qu@@ ito sw@@ arms are big enough to take down a car@@ ib@@ ou
many studies have highlighted species made more vulnerable by a warming climate , but global warming has proven a bo@@ on to some .
one of those species is the arc@@ tic mos@@ qu@@ ito .
according to researchers at the D@@ art@@ mouth College , warmer temperatures in the arc@@ tic have enabled mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes there to emerge earlier in the year and grow to larger siz@@ es , thus boosting population siz@@ es .
in a new study , arc@@ tic researchers at D@@ art@@ mouth &apos;s John S@@ loan D@@ ick@@ ey Center for International Understanding used their field observ@@ ations to model the effects of temperature changes on arc@@ tic mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes .
their analysis predic@@ ts a 50 per@@ cent increase in the survival rate of adult mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes with just a 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise .
mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes may be small , but they &apos;re a significant member of the arc@@ tic food chain and ecosy@@ stem .
the new analysis -- detailed in a new paper published in Proc@@ e@@ edings of the Royal Society B -- aims to help bi@@ ologists better predict how a growing mos@@ qu@@ ito population might affect the car@@ ib@@ ou they feed on , the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pol@@ lin@@ ate .
to build their model , D@@ art@@ mouth scientists combined their field results with results of their lab experiments , which looked at how temperature affects the ins@@ ect &apos;s growth and suscep@@ tibil@@ ity to pre@@ d@@ ation .
while a rise in temperature makes developing mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes more vulnerable to div@@ ing be@@ et@@ les , it also gives them a head start in the spring and makes their lar@@ val development faster and more efficient -- a net positive .
more mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes likely means a growing population -- but only as big as the insects &apos; food sources can sustain .
the ability for mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes to turn their improved surviv@@ ability rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to secure a blood meal .
Anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant use during pregnancy does not affect child
three new studies show the use of anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants by pregnant women does not have neur@@ o@@ develop@@ mental or beh@@ avi@@ oral effects on their children .
the studies showed that selective ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in re@@ up@@ take inhib@@ itors , or S@@ SR@@ Is , carry an increased risk for post@@ part@@ um ble@@ eding , however researchers said depression poses a greater risk for women and their children , which requires it to be addressed .
&quot; these studies add to a growing body of evidence about the safety of taking anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants during pregnancy , &quot; John Th@@ or@@ p , deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the International Journal of Ob@@ st@@ etr@@ ics and Gy@@ nec@@ ology , which published all three of the studies , said in a press release .
while there are some increased risks , the evidence so far seems to be that the risks of un@@ treated depression out@@ weigh the risks of taking them .
the Norwegian Institute of Public Health conducted a study on motor development of children whose mothers were treated with S@@ SR@@ Is by analy@@ z@@ ing data on 5@@ 1,4@@ 04 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child coh@@ ort Study , looking at the effects of S@@ SRI use on motor skill development at age 3 .
the researchers found 3@@ 81 mothers had used S@@ SR@@ Is while pregnant , and 159 of them were treated with the drugs for a prolonged period .
while exposure to S@@ SR@@ Is was weak@@ ly associated with a delay in motor development , researchers wrote in the study that the association was &quot; not to the extent that the delay was of clinical importance . &quot;
a group of researchers at the University of Adel@@ aide in Australia conducted a review of data on 4@@ 9,000 women in the Danish National Bir@@ th coh@@ ort to find the effects of S@@ SRI use on children &apos;s behav@@ ior by age 7 .
the study found that un@@ treated depression in pregnant women was associated with increased risk for problem behav@@ ior .
in the 210 children whose mothers were treated for depression with S@@ SR@@ Is there was no increased risk for beh@@ avi@@ oral problems , as compared with 2@@ 31 children who were more likely to have behav@@ ior issues such as hyper@@ activity , in@@ attention , and pe@@ er problems .
the same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to experience ble@@ eding after giving birth if they were treated with S@@ SR@@ Is .
the review of medical data for 3@@ 0,@@ 19@@ 8 women who gave birth at a teaching hospital in Adel@@ aide between 2002 and 2008 showed the risk for post@@ part@@ um h@@ emor@@ r@@ h@@ aging increased by 5 per@@ cent , from 11 to 16 per@@ cent , if women were treated with S@@ SR@@ Is .
the risk of a severe h@@ emor@@ r@@ h@@ age or post@@ part@@ um an@@ emia also doubled , the researchers reported .
the researchers said that while the study linked S@@ SRI use to the increased risk , there is a large number of vari@@ ables -- from drugs used during delivery to the limited amount of information researchers had about specific medical conditions of the women -- which all could have an effect on the potential for ble@@ eding .
&quot; it is possible that the women who took anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants late in pregnancy were those with the most severe illness and it is this which is responsible for the increased risk of post@@ part@@ um ha@@ emor@@ r@@ h@@ age and not the anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant , &quot; said Dr . Luke Gr@@ z@@ es@@ k@@ o@@ wi@@ ak , a professor at the University of Adel@@ aide .
based on this study alone we do not recommend that women stop taking medic@@ ation for depression during pregnancy , but are closely monitored in order to reduce the risk of any potential increased risk of ble@@ eding as much as possible .
Matthew indicted on murder charge in killing of Va . tech student
the man accused of killing University of Virginia student Hann@@ ah Grah@@ am has been indicted on a charge of first @-@ degree murder in the sl@@ aying of a Virginia T@@ ech student who went missing in 2009 , authorities announced Tuesday .
a grand jury in Alb@@ em@@ ar@@ le County , Va . , on Friday indicted Jes@@ se L@@ ero@@ y Matthew Jr . , 33 , of Charlot@@ tes@@ ville , in the killing of Morgan Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton , officials said .
Matthew also has been charged with abduc@@ tion with intent to def@@ ile .
each charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison .
Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton , 20 , disappeared outside a concert in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville in 2009 , and her remains were discovered three months later .
her parents said the news of the indictment was a relief .
&quot; it &apos;s something we &apos;ve been working for determin@@ edly and dilig@@ ently for six years , &quot; said G@@ il Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton , Morgan &apos;s mother .
I am very pleased to know that when you take a life , there should be consequences to that act .
the domin@@ oes of consequences have been set into motion for Jes@@ se Matthew .
police have said a forensic link connected the cases of Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton , Grah@@ am and a 2005 sexual assault in F@@ air@@ fax County .
in June , Matthew was convicted of the last crime and is awaiting sent@@ encing in that case .
he remains in jail in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville .
Jes@@ se Matthew to face capital murder charges in U @-@ V@@ a. student &apos;s death
Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton had trav@@ el@@ ed to U @-@ V@@ a. on Oc@@ t . 17 , 2009 , to attend a Met@@ all@@ ica concert with friends .
the group became separated when Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton left Charlot@@ tes@@ ville &apos;s John Paul Jones Arena to use the bathroom and could not get back inside .
she was last seen trying to catch a ride around 8 : 30 p.m. outside the arena .
at the time , Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton was wearing a black T @-@ shirt for the band Pant@@ era .
after her disappearance , Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s pur@@ se and cel@@ l@@ phone were discovered in the parking lot of the arena .
family and friends began a massive search for Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton , an education major who wanted to be a teacher , and Met@@ all@@ ica public@@ iz@@ ed her disappearance on its Web site .
in November 2009 , the T @-@ shirt she was wearing was found near a row of apartments in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville .
then , in January 2010 , her body was discovered in a remote h@@ ay@@ field on a farm south@@ west of Charlot@@ tes@@ ville .
around the time of Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s disappearance , Matthew had worked as a ca@@ b driver in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville , although it &apos;s unclear whether that period over@@ lap@@ ped with the date when Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton disappeared .
police said a significant break in Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s case came with Matthew &apos;s arrest in Grah@@ am &apos;s disappearance last year .
officials familiar with the investigation said the cases are linked by DNA evidence .
investigators have not detailed publicly any new evidence that might have led them to charge Matthew in Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s sl@@ aying now .
capital defender Douglas Ram@@ se@@ ur , who is representing Matthew in the Grah@@ am case , declined to comment .
the announcement of the charges comes two days after the one @-@ year anniversary of Hann@@ ah Grah@@ am &apos;s disappearance on S@@ ept .
that case has similarities with Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s : both were young college students who disappeared after n@@ ights out in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville .
Grah@@ am , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old from F@@ air@@ fax County , was last seen walking with Matthew on a downtown mall near the U @-@ V@@ a. campus .
Matthew was arrested in that case weeks later after a nation@@ wide man@@ hunt .
Grah@@ am &apos;s body was discovered in October .
Matthew is scheduled to stand trial in Grah@@ am &apos;s capital murder case in July .
in the early days of Grah@@ am &apos;s disappearance last fall in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville , G@@ il Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton became a presence at rallies and vig@@ il for the missing U @-@ V@@ a. student .
Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton said that she has end@@ ured speculation and criticism in the media about her daughter that she says must be sil@@ enced by the new charges against Matthew .
&quot; it valid@@ ates that along this path there &apos;s been some &quot; Why was she wearing a mini @-@ skir@@ t ? &quot; and &quot; W@@ as she asking for it ? &quot; kind of talk , and that kind of questioning and character@@ iz@@ ation doesn &apos;t hold up when it &apos;s clear there was a pre@@ dator on the pro@@ w@@ l , &quot; Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton said .
in the F@@ air@@ fax County case , Matthew was convicted of sex@@ ually ass@@ a@@ ulting a young woman in 2005 .
the woman , who was 26 at the time of the attack , told jur@@ ors that a str@@ anger came up behind her as she was walking home from a gr@@ oc@@ ery store on a September evening .
she said he carried her to a gr@@ assy area , beat and cho@@ ked her , and then sex@@ ually ass@@ a@@ ul@@ ted her .
&quot; I was thinking , &quot; This is going to be the end , keep scre@@ aming , keep scre@@ aming , &quot; &quot; the woman testified .
I feared this is going to be the end of my life .
Matthew suddenly ran off , the woman said .
a prosecutor told jur@@ ors that Matthew may have been start@@ led by the lights of a car pul@@ ling into a nearby parking lot .
he was charged years later after DNA linked him to the case .
Matthew is scheduled to be sentenced in October .
Matthew is scheduled to make his first court appearance in the Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton case in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville on Wednesday afternoon .
Dan Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton , Morgan &apos;s father , said he will likely be in Charlot@@ tes@@ ville on Wednesday and will visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen .
&quot; we have at least taken another step today , &quot; Dan Har@@ r@@ ing@@ ton said .
did J@@ on S@@ now die or not ?
actor K@@ it Har@@ ing@@ ton gives us a clu@@ e
actor K@@ it Har@@ ing@@ ton gave an important clu@@ e about the fate of his character in the series Games of thr@@ ones , J@@ on S@@ now , who was killed at the end of season four .
in an interview with Dutch magazine Hum@@ o , he said he knows the length of his contract with H@@ BO , according to Digital Sp@@ y .
asked how many seasons he will star in , he said he could not talk about this topic .
let &apos;s just say that the series will be a part of my life for some time , I &apos;ll probably have more than 30 years when it will end .
but one thing is certain .
&quot; when I will leave Games of thr@@ ones , that will be the time I will bury myself into full @-@ length film projects &quot; said the actor .
the series returns on the small screen next spring .
games of thr@@ ones fans sparked hysteria after the end of season four when J@@ on S@@ now &apos;s character was stabbed , and numerous theories were launched , according to which he will be somehow brought back to life .
moreover , the Romanians created a Facebook event called &quot; J@@ on S@@ now &apos;s Al@@ MS &quot; 40 days after the end of the season , which gathered more than 3@@ 6,000 supporters .
good news for Romania from the European Commission
the European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the &quot; Economic competitiveness &quot; and &quot; Environment &quot; program@@ s , both interrupted in early April 2015 .
according to a press release of Romania &apos;s Represent@@ ation of the European Commission , following this decision , approximately 120 million euro will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the near future .
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and I appreciate the efforts of the Romanian authorities to improve the management and control systems of the two program@@ s .
it is important that the Romanian authorities made an effort to identify the weaknesses and solve the problems .
&quot; I hope that the measures taken will reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future , &quot; said European Commissioner for Regional Policy , Corina Cretu .
&quot; the extremist statements made by Gi@@ anni Pit@@ ella are incorrec@@ t , &quot; stated the head of the Hungarian diplomacy .
Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to urged European Socialists to stop their &quot; campaign of lies &quot; against Hungary .
referring to the statements made by Har@@ lem Des@@ ir , the French Secretary of State for European Affairs , on the fence built by Hungary , Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to stressed that Budapest &quot; supports a common European strategy for immigration , &quot; insisting however that national borders should be protected .

refugee crisis : JHA with no solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that on Thursday he will take a decision on the possible conven@@ ing of a European Union summit on the migration in Europe .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Austrian counterpart Werner Fay@@ mann called on Tuesday for a European Union summit next week to solve the refugee crisis .
in a joint press conference in Berlin , Merkel said that Germany , Austria and Sweden cannot manage alone the refugee crisis .
the head of the German Government has expressed her support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls due to the massive influx of asylum seekers , noting that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees .
in turn , Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission &apos;s proposal to re@@ distribute refugees between member states based on compulsory quotas - called for an extraordinary EU summit .
Interior ministers from EU states , meeting in Brussels on Monday evening , failed to adopt the new proposal for the emergency redistribution of 120,000 refugees among the Member States of the European Union submitted by the European Commission on September 9 .
the first point of the plan , represented by the emergency resettlement of refugees mechanism , provides quick re@@ deployment of 5@@ 4,000 refugees located in Hungary , 5@@ 0,@@ 400 in Greece and 15,@@ 500 in Italy .
Charlie he@@ b@@ do , new controversial caric@@ atures
the French sati@@ r@@ ical magazine Charlie he@@ b@@ do causes controversy again after the publication of some caric@@ atures moc@@ king the response of predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries affected by wars .
in its latest issue , the publication draws attention and criticism again on social networks , writes Reuters .
one of the drawings shows a heart @-@ breaking image of A@@ ylan Kur@@ di , the drowned Syrian boy , whose body reached one of the Turkish beaches , after a failed attempt of his family to cross the sea by boat from Syria to Greece .
the drawing from Charlie he@@ b@@ do shows a child in shor@@ ts and T @-@ shirt , face down on the se@@ ash@@ ore , near a bill@@ board which offers two children &apos;s men@@ us at the price of one .
&quot; so close to succeed &quot; is the message accompanying the drawing .
another drawing , also the work of a carto@@ on@@ ist who survived the attack on the editorial office in Paris , in January , is accompanied by the message &quot; Pro@@ of that Europe is Christian . &quot;
the drawing also shows a figure similar to Jesus walking on water , while a smaller character we@@ ars shor@@ ts and is with his feet up@@ side down in water , the first saying &quot; Christians walk on water , &quot; and the second &quot; Muslim children dro@@ wn . &quot;
the French magazine has become a symbol of freedom of expression , after it was the target of an attack by Islamic militants in January , as a result of repeated threats for moc@@ king Prophet Mohammed .
a supermarket chain with branches in Romania , fined dr@@ astically in Russia
the French supermarket chain Auchan was fined more than 3@@ 70,000 dollars by Russian officials , being accused with food safety violations .
Anna Pop@@ ova , head of the Russian consumer protection agency Ros@@ pot@@ reb@@ nad@@ z@@ or , said that the fines total more than 25 million rub@@ bles , i.e. 37@@ 2,000 dollars , reports Associated Press , quoted by US News .
however , the reasons for these fines were not revealed and Auchan did not make any comment .
in addition , the French supermarket chain is accused by the Russian agency for agriculture , which claims that some meat products have been found to be contaminated with bacteria such as E. coli and list@@ eria .
food controls come at a time of tension between France and Russia on the enlargement of the European Union &apos;s sanctions and France &apos;s decision to cancel an agreement for the supply of Mistral ships to Russia .
Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary may build a metal fence at the border with Romania .
the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the news about this decision came up short and that this is not a politically correct gesture .
the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs decl@@ ares , in a press release to Ziare.com , that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this intention shortly before being publicly announced .
in turn , the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed in a timely and urgent manner the competent decision making bodies of Romania about this situation .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that raising a fence between two member states of the European Union which are also strategic partners is not a politically correct gesture , in accordance with the European spirit .
this position has already been communicated to the Hungarian side , it is mentioned in the press release .
Hungary is making plans to build a metal fence on the border with Romania , in the context of the immigrants crisis , declared on Tuesday the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to , quoted by Mediafax .
&quot; the measure is necessary because human traffickers trans@@ iting Serbia change their routes , and there is the possibility they head towards Romania , &quot; said the head of the Hungarian diplomacy .
&quot; the fence would start at the border between Hungary / Serbia / Romania and continue for a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration moves to Romania , &quot; said Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to .
in late August , the press reported that non @-@ EU immigrants trans@@ iting Serbian territory in their way to the EU were trying to bypass the fence built by the Hungarian authorities by its eastern end at the common border between Serbia , Hungary and Romania .
in this context , non @-@ EU immigrants discovered they can bypass the fence in the loc@@ alities Maj@@ dan / R@@ ade ( Serbia ) - Be@@ ba Veche ( Timis , Romania ) - K@@ ü@@ bek@@ h@@ á@@ za ( Hungary ) .
the Hungarian government allocated 22.@@ 2 billion for@@ ints ( 7@@ 1.8 million euros ) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia , for a distance of 175 kilometres and for special accommodation centres necessary for immigrants .
the fence initiative is critic@@ iz@@ ed by the European Union and Serbia .
there is no need , it will stay there
the coffin with the body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor will not be placed in Romania &apos;s Senate , despite the politician &apos;s wid@@ ow wish .
according to a press release issued to Ziare.com , the Senate &apos;s Permanent Bureau has discussed on Tuesday a request made by Doina Vadim Tudor , regarding the placement of the body of the former senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the Senate &apos;s seat .
&quot; from the rece@@ ip@@ t of this letter until the time of its analysis , in the Permanent Bureau , the body has already been depos@@ ited in a place of worship and it will remain there , the Permanent Bureau considering that there no need for it to be moved from there to the Senate , &quot; the Senate of Romania notes .
PNL ( Liberal National Party ) Senator Teodor Atanasiu said that this request &quot; is not in agreement with the geographical position of Romania somewhere in Europe . &quot;
in addition , according to Agerpres , the senators held a moment of silence in memory of the former PRM ( Great Romania Party ) leader , at the proposal of UNPR ( National Union for the Progress of Romania ) Senator Serban MI@@ H@@ AI@@ L@@ ES@@ CU .
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died Monday evening at around 6 : 30 p.@@ m ..
the PRM President passed away in the Emergency Centre of the Army &apos;s Cardi@@ ovascul@@ ar Dis@@ eases Clinic .
the MEP will be buried on Thursday at 12 : 00 at Ghencea cemetery and he will receive military honours .
V@@ in refugiatii in Romania ?
the mayors of the border towns asked about accommodation
the May@@ ors of the border towns from Arad county are questioned by the police and border police for accommodation for potential refugees who could arrive in Romania , but also for the gendarm@@ erie , if they are to be deployed on the border .
the Mayor of Nadlac , Vasile Cic@@ eac , said he had meetings on this topic .
the discussions were held including with farmers in the area , who were asked to report the presence on any foreigners near the border .
I had discussions with the border police , national police and local police , but also with the farmers in the area .
we all need to be more vigilant in the coming period .
&quot; we have asked the farmers , who work on the arable lands during this time , to be alert and report any movement , &quot; said the mayor .
migrants crisis erup@@ ts in Hungary : arm@@ our @-@ cl@@ ad vehicles and water cannons at the border
like the other mayors from the border with Hungary , he said that the police demanded information on accommodation available in case of a wave of refugees .
we were asked how many people we can accommodate .
in our town there is no space for refugees .
we believe that such special centres should not exist at the border , because they are more difficult to control , as the migrants are tempted to flee , because they are not interested to remain in Romania .
the best thing would be to be set up such centres in areas far from the border &quot; stated the Mayor of Ir@@ at@@ osu comm@@ une , Papp AT@@ I@@ LA Iosif .
in turn , the mayor of Dorob@@ anti comm@@ une , V@@ incenti@@ u Al@@ ma@@ si , said that he was asked about accommodation places for both the refugees and the intervention forces if they were to be deployed in the area .
the police asked if we can accommodate gendarmes too .
we can find places in the Cultural Cent@@ res , but we cannot accommodate refugees .
&quot; we have also been asked about the length of the border with Hungary . they are probably working on an action plan , &quot; said V@@ incenti@@ u Al@@ ma@@ si .
he added that at the local police station , &quot; starting Tuesday , when Hungary has sealed its border with Serbia , a permanent activity was established . &quot;
&quot; there is always a police officer in the station , and people know they have to report if they see any foreig@@ ner in the area , &quot; stated the mayor .
Pil@@ u City Hall representatives said they can accommodate no more than a hundred people in the Cultural Centre , and the information was provided to the police , at their request .
in addition , the Mayor of Curt@@ ici city , Nicolae A@@ an@@ itei , said there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local Public Finance Directorate , but improvements are necessary .
moreover , a former Bar@@ r@@ ack of the Border Police could be equipped to accommodate refugees .
the representatives of the Press Office of Arad County Police Department did not comment on the questioning of May@@ ors during this time , confirming only that &quot; in the border towns of Arad county the patr@@ ol@@ ling activities were intensified . &quot;
the Army Club commander announces radical measures against Becali &apos;s Steaua
the Army Sport Club commander , Colonel George Bor@@ oi announces a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali &apos;s Steaua .
although the two sides have negotiated a reconciliation , Bor@@ o says the Army will have its own football team , which will take over the historic record of the &quot; red @-@ blue &quot; team .
the team that won the Champions Cup is on break for now .
&quot; this is not a historical break , it &apos;s just a competition break , because we have no team , but things could change next year , &quot; said Bor@@ oi to Sport.ro .
at the same time , he announced that the law@@ suit request@@ ing damages from Becali &apos;s team will continue .
the period to which we refer by the High Court of Cassation and Justice &apos;s decision is clearly established .
we must recover the damage from FC Steaua , the team which used the Steaua brand without its owner consent - namely CSA Steaua .
the continuity of the section is also very clear , which has actually continuously belonged to the Army .
&quot; so Steaua Bucuresti football team , in one way or another , but in a legal form , must exist as the one to continue the performances it has so far in its record , &quot; says George Bor@@ oi .
Becali &apos;s Steaua and the Army Club are in an opened war since late last year , when the Supreme Court ruled that the soldiers are the owners of the brand &quot; Steaua . &quot;

the region &quot; full &quot; of mil@@ li@@ on@@ aires
Asia @-@ Pacific mil@@ li@@ on@@ aires will form this year the group with the richest people in the world , thanks to their fort@@ un@@ es accumulated in China and India , according to a study released on Wednesday by R@@ BC We@@ alth Management and Cap@@ gem@@ ini .
according to this document , in 2015 the cumulative fort@@ un@@ es of Asia Pacific mil@@ li@@ on@@ aires will exceed the total of 15.@@ 800 billion dollars recorded in 2014 and the fort@@ un@@ es of the North America &apos;s mil@@ li@@ on@@ aires , which currently represent the richest people in the world , with a cumulative fortune of 16,@@ 200 billion dollars , according to AFP .
the study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the highest number of very rich people , known in financial j@@ arg@@ on as High Net Wor@@ th In@@ divid@@ uals , H@@ N@@ W@@ I , with 4.@@ 69 million of such individuals in 2014 compared to 4.@@ 68 million in North America .
H@@ N@@ W@@ Is are people who can invest at least a million dollars , without taking into account the value of real estate and other pos@@ sessions .
&quot; in the future , H@@ N@@ W@@ Is fortune is expected to grow further in the Asia Pacific region than in any other region of the world , most of the new fort@@ un@@ es coming from the emerging economies of China , India , Indonesia and Thailand , &quot; mentions the study conducted by Cap@@ gem@@ ini and R@@ BC We@@ alth Management .
the report estimates that China and India account for nearly 10 % of the global H@@ N@@ W@@ I wealth and are responsible for 17 % of global growth of new fort@@ un@@ es after 2006 .
China , the world &apos;s second largest economy after the US , had in 2014 a total of 89@@ 0,000 mil@@ li@@ on@@ aires with an accumulated fortune of 4.@@ 500 billion dollars and an increase of 17.@@ 5 % and 19.@@ 3 % compared to 2013 .
in turn , India has the fastest growing number of mil@@ li@@ on@@ aires , 26.@@ 3 % , up to 198@@ ,000 persons , while their accumulated fortune grew by 28.@@ 2 % to 7@@ 85 billion dollars .
an incompetent worker mounted a traffic light system up@@ side down
in Suceava , workers installed a traffic light up@@ side down , so instead of being notified that they have to wait 4 seconds , pass@@ ers @-@ by receive the &apos; h &apos; message that they do not know how to dec@@ ip@@ her .
but no wor@@ ries , as everyone crosses the street on the red light , Adevarul inform@@ s .
everyone crosses as they feel like it .
two boys were on the point of being hit by a car because they crossed the street on the red light .
&quot; policemen from the Traf@@ fic Department should be here to help , until people get used to this , &quot; said a woman for the quoted source .
the traffic light was recently installed in front of Great Square in the centre of Suceava , but pass@@ ers @-@ by do not seem at all eager to take it into account , more so than the information received seems incomprehensible .
after 6 comes 8 followed by an L , instead of the 9 @-@ 8 @-@ 7 series .
if the worker did his job properly and there was someone responsible enough to give his approval to finish the work , then this absurd situation would not have existed .
the Head of Street Administration and Road signalling Service of Suceava City Hall admits candid@@ ly that he was there when the lights began to operate , but he did not realiz@@ e something was wrong .
we have commissioned them , but we did not realiz@@ e there was an error .
&quot; I , myself , was there when they were commissioned , &quot; said Stefan Vas@@ in@@ cu , promising that the problem will be solved in the shortest time .
thank God it can be remedi@@ ed , because there are cases in which the same type of incompetent workers have made ir@@ repar@@ able damage .
for example , when working on the Giurgiu @-@ Ruse pipeline , a worker w@@ an@@ dered the mil@@ ling dr@@ ill which was d@@ igg@@ ing the tunnel under the Danube , nobody knows where , probably underground , buried , since nobody found it , as claimed even by the Minister of Economy , Mihai Tudose .
the police used water cannons on immigrants
Hungarian guards used on Wednesday water cannons and te@@ arg@@ as against immigrants at the main Hungarian border with Serbia .
although Hungary has closed the border with barbed wire fence and introduced tough measures against illegal immigrants , including arrest , refugees continue to gather at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , according to The Guardian .
water cannons were put into operation when the immigrants managed to enter through the barbed wire fence at the R@@ ö@@ sz@@ ke border crossing point .
Hungarian police said that the use of water cannons was a measure to control the crowd , who was throwing water bottles .
there are no reports of any injuries , but some people were crying after the use of te@@ arg@@ as .
the Greek publication en@@ ik@@ os writes at the same time that two German companies refuse to deliver barbed wire to Hungary .
the country has already raised the fence on the border with Serbia and on Tuesday announced its intention to raise one at the border with Romania , an initiative strongly critic@@ iz@@ ed by Bucharest .
German companies argue that barbed wire is very dangerous and can cause cuts that can become infected .
it is used to secure prisons or military facilities , but should not be used against people seeking shelter , said the companies &apos; representatives .
in parallel with the Hungarian border confron@@ t@@ ations , Croatia has mobil@@ iz@@ ed to provide buses to the immigrants to transport those who come at the country &apos;s border with Serbia .
the Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that buses were sent to the border to bring immigrants to the reception centres .
3@@ 73 people entered into Croatia from Serbia , including 73 children , added the Ministry .
Tsipras about the Greek drama - why he agrees with the third agreement with EU
the purpose of the former Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels .
eventually , the leader of Syriza party made Greece enter into a third loan agreement , which results in more years of austerity and reform , according to Euronews which publish@@ es an interview with him .
now , however , Tsipras asks the Greeks again to entr@@ ust him with the prime minister position , during an election which he says will strengthen his political position .
our goal was to get an agreement , not to exit from the Eurozone or the dismantling of the Eurozone .
&quot; now for the first time , the possibility for the restructuring of Greece &apos;s debt remains open , &quot; said the former Greek Prime Minister .
now we have an agreement that can be described as strict .
&quot; although I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in an agreement , &quot; said Tsipras .
he believes that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek Government , showing that the country &apos;s financial needs are covered until 2019 .
&quot; Alexis Tsipras also states that Greece &quot; definitely needs reforms , &quot; adding that the reform should begin with the state .
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27 , thus paving the way for early elections in September , after seven stor@@ my months at the lead of the Athens Executive , during which he approved a third saving loan for Greece .

actress Jennifer Li@@ en , known from the Star Tre@@ k series , where she acted for three seasons as K@@ ES , was arrested for in@@ decent exposure in front of children .
the incident that took her to jail , where she has been since September 3 - bail being set at $ 2,500 - took place in front of her house in Ten@@ nes@@ see .
the star began to quar@@ rel with a neighbour , Care@@ y Smith , due to one of her children who was crying , inform@@ s the Mirror .

they are being targeted by machin@@ eg@@ uns of the West .
stop supporting terrorism !
Syrian President Bashar al Assad gave a rare interview to the Russian media , in which he speaks about the refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and that the immigrants are being &quot; targeted . &quot;
&quot; the West we@@ ep@@ s for them and yet the West has supported terrorists even from the beginning of the crisis , when it was said that this is a peaceful uprising , &quot; said Assad , in an interview with Russia Today .
the leader in Damascus states his Western counterparts say that the situation in Syria is the same as the Islamic State terrorism , &quot; but it &apos;s happening because of the Syrian government , the Syrian regime or the Syrian president . &quot;
as long as this propaganda continues , there will be more refugees .
so it is not that Europe has not accepted or embrac@@ ed them as refugees , is about not treating the cause .
if you are worried about them , you are no longer supporting terrorists .
that &apos;s what we think about the crisis .
&quot; that is the core of all the issues regarding refugees , &quot; said the Syrian leader .
Assad continued to accuse Western countries and the way they treat refugees .
the West is now we@@ eping for the refugees with one eye and targets them with a machine gun with the other eye , because those refugees have actually left Syria due to terrorism , in principle because of terrorist crimes and second@@ arily because the results of terrorism .
&quot; when you have terrorism and the destruction of the infrastructure , you will no longer have basic living resources , and as a result many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to earn a living somewhere in this world , &quot; says Bashar al Assad .
&quot; if you ask any Syrian today what he wants , the first thing he would say would be &apos; We want security and safety for every person and every family &apos; , &quot; said the Syrian President , adding that political forces , whether they are part of the Government or not , &quot; should unite around what is wanted by the Syrian people . &quot;
the Syrian President believes that the dialogue in his country should continue &quot; to reach a consensus , &quot; which cannot be implemented &quot; unless Syria over@@ powers terrorism . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism , because this is how the political objectives can be achieved , objectives that we as Syrians , want to achieve through dialogue and political action , &quot; said Bashar al Assad .
he also spoke about one of his country &apos;s allies , Russian President Vladimir Putin , saying that , in the context of the Ukraine crisis , he was transformed from a friend of the West to its fo@@ e .
Bashar al Assad comp@@ ares the situation in Syria to that in Russia , once again accusing the West of fal@@ si@@ fying reality in both cases .
watch what happened in the Western media after the blow in Ukraine .
what happened ?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an fo@@ e and was character@@ iz@@ ed as a t@@ sar .
he is por@@ tr@@ ayed as a dictator who sup@@ pres@@ ses the opposition in Russia and who came to power by un@@ democratic means , despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections , and the West itself has acknowledged that the elections were democratic .
now , they are no longer democratic .
&quot; this is Western propaganda , &quot; said the leader in Damascus .
last but not least , he included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is ready to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , along with Iran and Iraq , &quot; as they faces the same kind of terrorism . &quot;
instead , Bashar Assad critic@@ iz@@ ed Turkey , another neighbouring country , President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , saying that &quot; they cannot make even a move without coordinating first with the United States and other Western countries . &quot;
in addition , Syria &apos;s President accuses the &quot; international coalition &quot; led by the United States , which f@@ ights against terrorism : &quot; in fact , since this coalition began to operate , the Islamic State has begun to expand . &quot;
in other words , the coalition has failed and has no impact in the field .
meanwhile , countries such as Turkey , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide coverage for terrorism , as France , the US and others cannot fight terrorism .
you cannot be against terrorism and fight terrorism at the same time .
&quot; but if these countries decide to change their policies and realiz@@ e that terrorism is a scor@@ p@@ ion - if you put in your pocket , it will sting you - then we have no obj@@ ection in cooper@@ ating with all these countries , since it is a real coalition not a fake one , which f@@ ights against terrorism , , &quot; said the leader in Damascus .

Bucharest will register 26 degrees at noon .
two degrees less will be at the seaside , while in the mountains we will have 26 degrees in Brasov .
there will be 21 degrees at Mo@@ ec@@ iu , 23 in Bran , 23 at Par@@ aul Rece , 20 in PRE@@ DE@@ AL and 20 Busteni .
the weather will be somewhat warmer in the West of the country , where the air temperature will go over 30 degrees .

map of the countries with the biggest price reductions and Romania &apos;s position among them
the collapse of oil prices caused great losses last year to the workers in oil production , shareholders of energy companies and countries heavily dependent on this resource .
but there is also a positive effect : gasoline &apos;s price has decreased enormously .
a map compiled by Bloomberg shows that during October 2014 - July 2015 in nearly all the 76 countries considered , fuel prices have decreased .
the most significant price reduction at the p@@ ump is observed in Venezuela .
in this country , diesel oil got cheaper by 97 % , so you can fuel 24 SU@@ V@@ s with less than one dollar .
at the opposite side is Saudi Arabia , where the price is kept steady by the state .
the cost of diesel oil varies from country to country , depending on the refin@@ ing conditions , changes in terms of taxation , and exchange rate fluctu@@ ations .
for a more accurate comparison , Bloomberg has turned the average price of each state into US dollars .
the situation in Romania
Bloomberg data show that , in the second quarter , the average price of a g@@ all@@ on of gasoline ( appro@@ x . 3.8 litres ) was $ 5.@@ 49 .
thus , we ranked 27th among the countries with the most expensive fuel .
but we should not worry about this position .
compared to the last quarter of 2014 , gasoline got cheaper in Romania as well .
then , the average price of a g@@ all@@ on was $ 6.@@ 14 , which means a price reduction of 10.@@ 6 % .
however , neighbouring countries rank better .
in Bulgaria , a g@@ all@@ on of gasoline costs 4.@@ 92 dollars and in Hungary - 5.@@ 20 dollars .
the Germans are pl@@ ot@@ ting the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night : what Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government will further support the 16 States of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants who enter the country via southern Europe .
after a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states , Merkel said &quot; the most important thing now is to create an ord@@ erly and transparent process to deal with the large numbers of refugees , &quot; notes DPA agency .
she added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals and distribution centres .
&quot; such piv@@ ot@@ al points are needed &quot; she said .
the whole country should provide a massive boost to deal with the crisis , Merkel added .
the States &apos; prime ministers demanded more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the government coalition at a federal level over a week ago .
Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ian Prime Minister Bo@@ do Ram@@ el@@ ow from the Left Party demanded &quot; at least a double amount , and regarding the arrangements , they should be accelerated , &quot; during some comments for a local newspaper .
in turn , R@@ h@@ in@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Prime Minister Mal@@ u Dre@@ yer insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society .
&quot; we need a national pact between all the players , not just the federal government , states and municipalities , but also business , trade unions and civil society , &quot; she said .
Dre@@ yer also asked that the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants be accelerated .
she noted that Switzerland has completed the processing within 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days , while Germany took more than 5 months .
Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Se@@ e@@ hofer expressed similar ideas .
until now , Bavaria carries the he@@ avi@@ est burden , with the largest number of migrants who have arrived after crossing the border with Austria .
Se@@ e@@ hofer , a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , a key component of the federal government coalition , has clashed publicly with Merkel after the Chancellor announced an open door virtual policy at the beginning of the month , states DPA .
Mircea Lucescu makes a scandal after the humiliating defeat by Real Madrid
Lucescu was extremely angry at the end of the match with Real Madrid , lost by Sahtior Donetk 0 @-@ 4 .
the Romanian coach was completely upset with the arbitration , saying that Sahtior lost because it was deprived .
before the match I said one thing , that I want to be respected .
unfortunately , in matches against maj@@ our European teams we are always disadvantaged by the referees .
there are two totally different attitudes .
we are given a yellow card immediately , while the top teams are not .
in addition , the first penalty was given for no reason !
the ball hit Dari@@ jo on the back without t@@ ouch@@ ing his hand .
a game of such level should not have been influenced by the referee .
&quot; I regret the fact that arbitration has ru@@ ined the game , &quot; Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference .
&quot; Madam , what is that aw@@ ful smell &quot; ?
it was the pieces of her dis@@ mem@@ bered husband
a murder of an extraordinary sad@@ ism terri@@ fied the residents of T@@ â@@ r@@ gu Frum@@ os and Roman .
yesterday morning , in the early hours , the mer@@ ch@@ ants of T@@ â@@ r@@ gu Frum@@ os were the witnesses of terri@@ fying scenes in the square outside the main entrance .
besides the three b@@ ins , fo@@ ren@@ s@@ ics had &quot; assem@@ bled &quot; the pieces of what appeared to be a man &apos;s body .
his body was cut into pieces but his head , internal organs and gen@@ it@@ als were missing .
in the end , it turned out to be the body of a former officer who was murdered by his wife , a geograph@@ y teacher .
&quot; Ziarul de Iasi &quot; ch@@ at@@ ted le@@ is@@ ure@@ ly with the taxi driver who un@@ know@@ ingly helped the criminal to carry the bags containing the body .
his story make you hair stand on end .
a taxi driver in T@@ â@@ r@@ gu Frum@@ os alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman was carrying three bags that emit@@ ted a terrible smell , after pieces of the body had been found in the market dum@@ p@@ ster .
similar to an American movie , the man himself un@@ know@@ ingly helped to carry the bags filled with human remains which emit@@ ted a terrible sten@@ ch . the criminal was his customer .
the taxi driver exclusively re@@ counted the story for &quot; Ziarul de I@@ a@@ ș@@ i . &quot; he told us the shocking situation he went through , un@@ wit@@ tin@@ g@@ ly helping a murderer hide the evidence .
he himself carried the bags containing the s@@ lic@@ ed body pieces of the geograph@@ y teacher &apos;s husband .
she came in T@@ â@@ r@@ gu Frum@@ os to hide evidence of the crime , as far away from her home in Roman .
maybe it &apos;s lamb .
I had no way of knowing .
uncle Mihai , as he is known by his p@@ als who work as taxi drivers in T@@ â@@ r@@ gu Frum@@ os , rock@@ eted to star@@ dom overnight in the small town he lives in .
he &apos;@@ d seen American movies throughout his life , but never believed he would ever be the witness of the discovery of such a sad@@ istic murder , and see the body pieces with his own eyes .
he re@@ counts that on the night of Monday to Tuesday , he was waiting as usual for the arrival of the regular coaches which trans@@ ited the town .
he was near the junc@@ tion of the roads which lead to Roman and Pa@@ ș@@ cani .
the cab@@ bie says he saw the k@@ iller in his re@@ ar @-@ view mirror , sitting next to the bags which contained human remains , le@@ an@@ ed against the road sign indicating the nearby loc@@ alities .
she arrived with the Mass@@ aro bus , at 1.@@ 30 at night .
the coach left her ten meters from the cros@@ sw@@ al@@ k of the road leading to Pa@@ ș@@ cani , exactly in front of the milestone .
the bags were le@@ an@@ ing against the road sign .
after the coach left , I backed up the car ten meters and stopped next to her .
I opened the tr@@ unk and after I loaded a bag , I asked :
I saw she was an older woman , and I wanted to help her .
I thought she was taking some meat to the market to sale it . it thought it was lamb . I had no way of knowing .
I thought she was trying to trick some@@ body into buying that sm@@ el@@ ly meat .
she was trying to lift bag by h@@ ers@@ el@@ f , and I rushed to help her .
I put my hand on top of the bag , near the por@@ tion were it was tied .
&quot; she told me to drop her off at the gate of the market , when I pic@@ ked her up at the bus stop &quot; said Un@@ cle Mihai .
the smell was so bad I could hardly sit in the car .
he added that the woman said absolutely nothing , and as a result , he didn &apos;t ask her anything .
I said nothing until we reached our destination because I was angry that she put a car@@ cas@@ s in my car .
when she un@@ loaded the bags out of the car , I noticed that the smell was even worse .
she took the bags out of the tr@@ unk .
when I got back into the car , I backed up a couple of meters to turn the car around , and I realised I co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t breathe because of the smell .
I left the car tr@@ unk open and I dr@@ ove around so the smell would go away .
at the bus stop I didn &apos;t notice if she was helped by someone with the bags , because lights were coming from behind and I co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t see in the mirr@@ ors .
&quot; there were two plastic bags and a r@@ aff@@ ia one , &quot; added the man .
seeing the woman &apos;s strange behaviour , he says he started to get curious .
in my mind , I realised that something was wrong .
after she took her bags out of the car , I left for the hospital , towards the town hall , and when I returned , I specifically looked to see what the woman was doing with her luggage .
in the meantime she had pulled the luggage behind the fence , near the b@@ ins inside the market .
then I left again .
a min@@ ib@@ us and a bus arrived from Italy causing some ag@@ itation .
I saw the woman going to the drivers and trying to board the buses , to disappear , but perhaps that the drivers didn &apos;t want to take her because they only do international routes , and do not accept occas@@ ional passengers .
the woman was very ag@@ itated , pac@@ ing back and for@@ th .
at one point , the woman entered a P@@ eco gas station and , out of curiosity , I asked an employee what she had done inside .
the employee replied that she w@@ ashed her hands .
then I asked him if he knew were the police pat@@ rol was , because I had seen it some time ago .
I &apos;ve searched and found the police coming towards the market .
I showed them the woman and told them that something was suspicious about her .
&quot; then I left , I had a ride to Bel@@ ce@@ ș@@ ti &quot; added Un@@ cle Mihai .
he told us that the woman became ag@@ itated after leaving the bags in the b@@ ins .
in my opinion , it was suspicions that the bags were gone , and I was curious what she did with them .
when police approached her and asked her what she was doing there , pointing towards me and saying that I warned them she had a suspicious bag .
then the woman went to the garbage c@@ ans and showed them the bags .
&quot; I returned to where she hid the bags around 3 a.m. when I gave statements to police and prosecutors at the scene , &quot; concluded the cab@@ bie .
Neamt prosecutors , who are investigating the case , say that the teacher aged 64 , Ana Zaharia was caught by the cameras of a gas stations in Roman at 0.@@ 55 , boarding a bus with the three bags .
she arrived in T@@ â@@ r@@ gu Frum@@ os@@ at 1 : 30 .
according to the investigators , she killed her husband , with whom she was married for four years , with a knife , then cut his body into pieces inside the house .
the man &apos;s name was Gheorghe Zaharia , and was a reserve officer .
on Sunday evening , the woman placed the body parts in two plastic bags , transporting the bags to the bus station , and hiding them .
the other night , she transported one more bag , then decided which direction to take . she chose the Bucharest - I@@ a@@ ș@@ i coach .
last night , prosecutors still did not know where the woman hid her husband &apos;s internal organs or gen@@ it@@ als .
the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags in a clos@@ et in the woman &apos;s apartment .
she was retired , like her husband .
until yesterday , prosecutors had@@ n &apos;t learned the mot@@ if for killing her husband in cold blood .
most likely , the teacher will undergo a psychiatric expertise , and the body will be examined by the forensic experts to formally determine the cause of death and any other relevant details .
the City Hall took over the national roads in the municipality , after they had been taken over by the Government years ago to be asph@@ al@@ ted with money from the national budget during the 2004 electoral campaign .
the decision was en@@ acted yesterday by the Local Council ( L@@ C ) , and in order for it to be implemented a Government Resolution is needed .
some sources say that the transfer of the management right from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a condition for that institution to grant approval for the General Urban Plan ( G@@ up ) .
city Hall took over a network of 11 km of roads .
however , a legislative amendment which was en@@ acted in July 2015 comp@@ elled the municipality to take over the national roads crossing the city .
an approval from the National Roads cannot be issued unless it compl@@ ies with the law , so it was necessary to approve this point .
the National roads fall upon our administration as of today .
&quot; of course , a government resolution has to be issued as a consequence of the City Council &apos;s decision &quot; said Ac@@ ting Mayor Mihai Chirica .
the National roads crossing the city are DN 24 and DN 28 .
National Road 28 crosses Iasi on the arteries : P@@ ă@@ cur@@ ari road , Munt@@ eni street ( at the traffic light , M@@ oara de F@@ oc , Str@@ ă@@ p@@ ung@@ erea Sil@@ vest@@ ru , Sil@@ vest@@ ru street , bd . Nicolae i@@ org@@ a , bd . Prim@@ ă@@ verii , Calea Chi@@ ș@@ in@@ ă@@ ului , Ț@@ u@@ ț@@ ora road until the exit from the city towards T@@ ome@@ ș@@ ti - Al@@ bi@@ ț@@ a .
the other national road , DN 24 , includes buc@@ ium road , bd . Socola ( until the traffic lights ) buc@@ ium Street ( until Base 3 ) , Calea Chisina@@ ului , bd . Tudor Vladimirescu , bd . C.@@ A. Ros@@ etti and exit onto C@@ â@@ r@@ li@@ g @-@ S@@ cul@@ eni .
Radu Gy@@ r and Eli@@ ade
continuing the description of some she@@ ets in the y@@ ou@@ thful political sympath@@ ies &quot; file &quot; of Mircea Eli@@ ade which , as briefly as they are presented , exceed the size of a newspaper article and must be dissemin@@ ated as a series , I think the friendship between Radu Gy@@ r and Mircea Eli@@ ade deserves to be evo@@ ked , one of the most vehement counts used by the detr@@ actors of the great Romanian schol@@ ar .
a less hum@@ orous description would hopefully be helpful in the real debate that the recent law , called &quot; anti @-@ legion@@ ary , &quot; ought to provoke in the Romanian intellectual environment .
by crit@@ ically analysing various ver@@ ses which spoke of Eli@@ ade &apos;s enrol@@ ment in the Leg@@ ion through the &quot; Ax@@ a &quot; N@@ est and Radu Gy@@ r , Florin Ț@@ ur@@ canu discus@@ ses these issues in the volume called Mircea Eli@@ ade .
Pr@@ izon@@ ierul istoriei ( The prisoner of history ) ( Bucharest , 2003 ) , is another hypothesis we are very interested in because we want to understand the resumption of the ep@@ ist@@ ol@@ ary contacts between Radu Gy@@ r and Eli@@ ade in 1968 , after Ceausescu had played the &quot; balcony scene &quot; in August of that year .
rel@@ ying on documents signed by Radu Gy@@ r after he was pres@@ sured during the Security Police investigation in 1941 , the documents kept in the Romanian Intelligence Service archives today ( F@@ D , file 5@@ 73 , F.@@ 15 ) and a prosecution note from 1938 , Florin Ț@@ ur@@ canu says that &quot; Eli@@ ade will not join their group , but the so @-@ called &quot; legion@@ ary family &quot; called Luminita ( The light ) , a group of intellectuals , especially writers , led by poet Radu Gy@@ r . &quot;
because there are no ver@@ ifi@@ able data regarding the Luminita nest , those that were ex@@ iled considered that the existence of this &quot; legion@@ ary family &quot; was questionable . what needs to be discussed is the context in which this information was recorded on file .
leaving aside the surprising kind@@ ness of the Romanian Intelligence Service to provide Mr . Ț@@ ur@@ canu with secret files , the most obvious thing is that , at the time , the target of the Security Police was &quot; commander &quot; Radu Gy@@ r . Eli@@ ade was mentioned in the note of 21 March 1938 , in the context in which Arm@@ and Calinescu , the Minister of the Interior was given free hand to take all necessary measures so that king Carol could be able to impose royal dictatorship , suspend@@ ing parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the Leg@@ ion@@ aries which started to receive an unexpected popularity ( the &quot; T@@ otul pentru ț@@ ar@@ ă &quot; ( anything for the country ) party ranked number 3 in the elections of 1937 ) .
Eli@@ ade &apos;s arrest was made as a result of this note , cited by Ț@@ ur@@ canu : &quot; Mircea Eli@@ ade , writer and journalist , registered in the legion@@ ary movement in 19@@ 35 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Dem@@ et@@ rescu Gy@@ r . &quot;
as for me , I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and is likely that such superficial notes have been made hast@@ ily for the great majority of the Leg@@ ion@@ aries or active public supporters who had to be arrested , but also had to be tied to an important Leg@@ ion@@ naire leader .
once Radu Gy@@ r was in custody in February 1941 , after the sup@@ pression of the legion@@ ary rebel@@ lion , he wrote the statement mentioned above , which merely confirms the first retrosp@@ ective method of ban@@ al bureaucratic cover in any polic@@ ing , authoritarian regime .
it would have been interesting if Ț@@ ur@@ canu would have provided more details about the content of quoted file no . 5@@ 73 .
was the file made for Eli@@ ade or Radu Gy@@ r ?
the file in question must have been created based on the documents issued by the Security Police , but processed by the State Security Directorate to be used against one or the other .
we are talking about an equivoc@@ ation , just as when using the term &quot; member &quot; of the Movement , known only by someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organiz@@ ation based on a religious foundation which is a preced@@ ing , trial stage in which the one at issue beh@@ aves as an active sympath@@ iz@@ er in the prob@@ ation period of three years before becoming a fl@@ ed@@ ged &quot; com@@ rade . &quot;
also , all these secondary forms of organiz@@ ation like intellectual clubs or circles , social gath@@ er@@ ings , discussion groups with the pe@@ as@@ ants , youth and student organiz@@ ations revol@@ ved around a nest . the people in these groups were families , not the nest itself as a co@@ hes@@ ive form of political organiz@@ ation and action .
such nuances completely evade the un@@ informed reader making Eli@@ ade &apos;s &quot; member &quot; status ( which may be pl@@ au@@ sible ) understood and used liter@@ ally to designate political en@@ rolling in the nest .
the invoc@@ ation of such sub@@ tle interpretation certainly cannot conceal the public support of the Guard and the clear sympathy for the Captain which spir@@ ited Eli@@ ade during 19@@ 35 @-@ 1940 , regardless of the wake of Nae Ionescu .
public support of a cause you believe in does not necessarily mean the actual political enrol@@ ment especially since , as a rule , this kind of intellectuals have a kind of super@@ ior@@ ity in comparison to the actual activists and join the politics only when they are directly offered the highest privileges .
as much as I was able to form an opinion about the type of Eli@@ ade &apos;s thinking at that time , when he was the &quot; leader of the young generation , &quot; I find it hard to believe that he could have accepted the hier@@ arch@@ ical rig@@ ors of a legion@@ ary nest .
and Radu Gy@@ r &apos;s intellectual ascend@@ ancy was not comparable to that of Nae Ionescu , though !
not to mention that every Leg@@ ion@@ naire &quot; file &apos;s &quot; main element is the anti @-@ Semitic and violent public activity , both worthy of being stigm@@ atiz@@ ed , non @-@ existent in case of Eli@@ ade , at least until proven otherwise .
as for the correspondence between Eli@@ ade and Gy@@ r between 1968 - 1969 , Mircea Han@@ do@@ ca , an enthusiastic defender of Eli@@ ade , tries to pen@@ aliz@@ e the statements of Florin Ț@@ ur@@ canu ( based however on some archive documents , even if they should have been seriously dis@@ s@@ ected and cont@@ ext@@ u@@ aliz@@ ed ) with a questionable argument .
in his volume &quot; noi gl@@ ose asupra lui Mircea Eli@@ ade &quot; ( Bucharest , 2006 ) , Mircea Han@@ do@@ ca finds that &quot; no line in the correspondence between Mircea Eli@@ ade and Radu Gy@@ r contains any al@@ lu@@ sion that would support that clas@@ sification . &quot;
when Radu Gy@@ r somehow managed to be released alive from the communist mines in 1968 , he co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t risk making any al@@ lu@@ sions in his letters , as they were obviously intercepted by the censorship .
I think that Mircea Han@@ do@@ ca was trying to emphas@@ ize that the tone of the letters sent by Radu Gy@@ r was one of respect , admiration and affection without any doubt regarding the ascend@@ ancy of Eli@@ ade .
there is really no suggestion that Radu Gy@@ r would have ever been the superior of Eli@@ ade .
being smart , the poet who was forced to write for Glas@@ ul Patr@@ iei ( The voice of the M@@ other@@ land ) , unve@@ ils from the outset his embarrass@@ ment by signalling Eli@@ ade ( who knew exactly what the mission of that publication was and was constantly denigr@@ ating the exile of people with liberal ideas ) in his signature , after the writing &quot; your old friend , &quot; telling him about what to expect . he is vis@@ ibly reli@@ ev@@ ed and happy when his friend responds aff@@ ection@@ ately after almost three decades of being apart , when the &quot; cun@@ ning time &quot; has alien@@ ated them .
there is no doubt that , beyond the &quot; mission &quot; he was tasked with ( to persuade Eli@@ ade that now he could easily return to the new Romania at least to see his mother and friends ) which he sk@@ il@@ fully fulfil@@ ls in a cold manner and in short sentences , delim@@ ited in paragraphs to suggest their foreign body character , Radu Gy@@ r only shows his interest in literature .
there were no question of es@@ ot@@ eric al@@ lu@@ sions , ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely suggested political complications or any evoc@@ ation of the youth years other than in a cultural manner .
it &apos;s hard to believe that Radu Gy@@ r was the Leg@@ ion@@ naire superior of Eli@@ ade , but until this version is strengthen with less circumst@@ anti@@ al evidence like that offered by Florin Ț@@ ur@@ canu , this correspondence shows sh@@ ards of memory which testify a mutual appreciation between characters who left their different but constant marks on our culture and , beyond the terrible trials of their lives , found the spirit of the Inter@@ war civiliz@@ ation and education .
important human and cultural and , why not ? , exemplary documents which evo@@ ke friendship and mutual respect beyond the &quot; time period &quot; destiny of the authors .
in the early 7@@ 0s , Eli@@ ade finally gives up his refugee status and ob@@ tains US citizenship and under the pretext offered by health problems and the catastrophic flooding in the country , announces the Socialist Republic of Romania authorities , through the embassy ( with which he had a spor@@ adic correspondence in order to get a passport for his sister ) that he cannot accept the invitation to return to the country .
the result was predictable : he once again index@@ ed , the &quot; Tol@@ ad@@ ot business &quot; is carried out in Israel , the books sent to his family and friends ( fragments d &apos;@@ un journ@@ al , G@@ all@@ im@@ ard , 1973 ) are ceased by the censorship and he never sees his mother again .
among all his friends who remained in the country , he only spor@@ ad@@ ically writes to No@@ ica , although , as evid@@ enced by the Chicago personal archive , surprisingly many individuals or Romanian institutions manage to send him messages .
it is clear why Radu Gy@@ r never received permission to write to him after 1969 .
after 1977 , when Ceausescu &apos;s regime once again tried to convince Eli@@ ade ( by official invitation , being approached by No@@ ica , transl@@ ations etc . ) Radu Gy@@ r had already passed away .
new coach , foreign players
because of the scar@@ city of local vol@@ ley@@ ball players , Pen@@ ic@@ ilina Iasi tested Serbian , Montenegrin , Bulgarian and Polish players in tournaments .
the players from Iasi participate in training tournaments under the command of coach Dan Gavril
dem@@ oted from the women &apos;s vol@@ ley@@ ball A1 Division in the first half of the year , Pen@@ ic@@ ilina Iasi retained its place in the first division due to the dis@@ band@@ ment of Stiinta Miros@@ lava , f@@ res@@ h@@ ly promoted to the first division after a disputed qualification tournament which took place in the town of Iasi county .
the news took the leadership of the group from Iasi by surprise . they found themselves without a head coach ( after the departure of Rares P@@ uni , who was now a deputy coach for Stiinta Bacau ) and lacking multiple player . some of the players were retired , like Cristina Lungu and stop@@ per Diana Stud@@ ineanu , and some were transferred , like Ana @-@ Maria Ber@@ d@@ ila ( to the champion Vol@@ ei Alba Blaj ) and sisters Maria and Iuliana fica .
naturally , until the resumption of the championship scheduled on October 10 , there was and still is time to complete the lot .
firstly they found a new coach , Dan Gavril , who came from the men &apos;s team L@@ PS Piatra Neamt , and had worked in recent years with Pen@@ ic@@ ilina . he is going to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile St@@ anga .
two players from the Stiinta Miros@@ lava , Raluca Pic@@ hiu and T@@ ati@@ ana Diacon@@ ita were also included in the team , and some foreign players from Bulgaria , Serbia , Montenegro and Poland were tested . the ones closest to being transferred were the Serbian player Kat@@ arina Jovanovic ( from A@@ mi@@ ens , France ) and Montenegrin Jelena C@@ vi@@ j@@ ovic ( Z@@ ren@@ janin ) .
earlier this month , Pen@@ ic@@ ilina led by Dan Gavril conducted a training camp in G@@ ura Hum@@ orului , then participated in a tournament held in Lugoj whose prize was Banat Cup . the players from Iasi achieved a win ( 3 @-@ 0 with Universitatea Cluj ) but they have also suffered two losses , 0 @-@ 3 with CSM Lugoj and S@@ CM@@ U Craiova .
next week , during 23 @-@ 25 September , Pen@@ ic@@ ilina will participate in another tournament in Craiova .
we are trying to form a valuable team for the new championship .
we have a skilled and experienced coach , but the number of players in Romania is quite low and therefore we resort to foreign vol@@ ley@@ ball players , especially after it was decided that teams can use any number of foreign players .
this decision will affect the younger generation of athletes from clubs in Romania .
&quot; we hope to be ranked 5 @-@ 6 at the end of the season , even if it is going to be very hard , &quot; said Vasile St@@ anga , President of ACS Pen@@ ic@@ ilina Iasi .
emotional meeting .
tw@@ ins reun@@ ited after almost 70 years
the tw@@ ins George Sk@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ nec@@ ky and Lucian Poz@@ n@@ anski , aged 69 , were born at the end of the Second World War in Germany , after their Polish mother had just been released form a labour camp .
as she was too sick to take care of them , the tw@@ ins were sent to Poland for adoption , and thus the two brothers were separated from the one who gave birth to them , but also from each other .
for decades George and Lucian did not know about each other &apos;s existence .
at the age of 17 , George discovered documents showing that he is adopted and that he has a brother .
in the 6@@ 0s , he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother , but they found no evidence to lead them to Lucian .
only in 2015 , thanks to the &quot; Rest@@ oring Family Lin@@ ks &quot; Program of the Red Cross , the tw@@ ins were reun@@ ited , and the moment was more than emotional .
BBC reporters surprised this episode .
ten children from Iasi brought home four medals from a sportive dance competition in Stuttgart
two gold medals , one silver medal and one bronze medal were won by the children from Iasi at the German Open Championship in Stuttgart , an international sportive dance competition organiz@@ ed by the German Spor@@ tive Dance Federation and the Spor@@ tive Dance World Federation .
five p@@ airs from Iasi who train at the Dance Energy Club participated in the event and d@@ anced together with 9,000 other athletes from 20 countries .
the 10 children from Iasi participated in five different categories ( juven@@ ile 1 , juven@@ ile 2 , junior 2 , youth and amateur ) .
the p@@ airs who returned home with medals were : R@@ ă@@ z@@ van Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tar@@ zi@@ anu ( two gold medals and one silver medal ) , Vlad Constantin Don@@ osa and O@@ til@@ ia Stef@@ ana Gal@@ van ( bronze medal ) .
other three p@@ airs have also managed to occupy leading places : Bogdan Stelian Duminica and Sara Maria Dol@@ niceanu , Vlad E@@ ne and Antonia Ioana Ios@@ u@@ b Cu@@ j@@ ba and last but not least Andrei Andrei Emil@@ ia and Raluca Elena Ionita .
as a coach I wanted enormously to re@@ confirm the results of this March , this re@@ confirmation being necessary both for us as teachers and for the athletes , in terms of their future evolution .
the fact that we were able to make the anthem of Romania sound twice this year in the German Open and return home with four medals , makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can promote both the club and the athletes at the highest level .
&quot; all this would only be achiev@@ able with the help of few important elements : commitment , respect , trust and a lot of work , &quot; said Andreea Ramona Manolache , the coach of the children in the Dance Energy Club .
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs , obtaining a total of 9 medals , thus qualifying our country on the 4th position out of the 20 participating countries .
we would also like to add that four of the medals were brought to Iasi .
6 ways to get rid of stress in under a minute
very few of us can afford to run for a weekend in the mountains to get rid of stress .
some of us do not have the time , the others - the finances and others both .
but there are solutions available to everyone who want to escape a little from stress .
they do not involve increased costs nor special time allocated , according ly@@ la@@ .ro .
everyday wor@@ ries are inevitable , but it depends on us how we face them and the attitude we have towards them .
instead of gr@@ inding on the inside and feel as if an impl@@ osion occurs in your mind , you should try instead the following relaxation methods which only take a minute .
breathe deeply
breathing exercises are not just for sol@@ o@@ ists and yo@@ ga pract@@ ition@@ ers .
they work for any person , and the adjustment of breath in a tense moment helps the release of endor@@ ph@@ ins in the body , a process that leads to a state of relaxation , inform@@ s Liv@@ estr@@ ong .
be chil@@ dish
we know that we have passed childhood and we cannot afford being c@@ ud@@ d@@ led when we feel like it .
but that does not mean we cannot go in a corner of the office building or anywhere we know we &apos;re alone ( even behind the building ) and scre@@ am from the top of our lungs .
you can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated during the day with a few strong scre@@ ams .
imagine a beautiful place
we know that this is worthy of a psych@@ otherapy session , but psychologists use it often for a reason .
imagin@@ ing a beautiful place that insp@@ ires calm and det@@ achment from the daily f@@ ren@@ zy could allev@@ iate the nervous state .
this is , indeed , about self @-@ suggestion , process which can really change lives , both for better or worse .
it all depends on what we self @-@ suggest .
it is best to think of an id@@ yl@@ lic place that w@@ arms our soul .
listen to music
put your head@@ phones on and listen to relax@@ ing music .
please note however that we are not talking about your favourite music , because if this happens to be heavy metal , you might find it difficult to relax .
listen to soft relax@@ ing tun@@ es without lyrics to find your balance when you become angry .
pe@@ el an orange
does it sound strange to pe@@ el an orange when you are nervous ?
well , it doesn &apos;t !
for it is not the fruit itself as it does not contain miracul@@ ous substances or X@@ an@@ ax to totally calm us ( occas@@ ionally too much ) .
it &apos;s all about arom@@ ath@@ er@@ apy !
the smell of the orange , during pe@@ eling , stimul@@ ates the brain to produce endor@@ ph@@ ins , the hor@@ m@@ one of well @-@ being .
P@@ at an animal
those who have pets around , be it at home , be it the one who stays near your working place , take a few seconds to pat it .
according to the National Centre for Inf@@ ecti@@ ous Dis@@ eases in the US , pat@@ ting animals can lower blood pressure .
Hora and rock with a violin and guitar
two musicians in love with instruments somewhat rivals but partners in this ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ic project sing Enescu , V@@ ival@@ di , B@@ ach , Pi@@ az@@ z@@ ol@@ la , B@@ rah@@ ms , M@@ anc@@ ini , Br@@ u@@ bec@@ k , Job@@ im , Dj@@ ango , Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in , pur@@ ple , Queen , Flo@@ y@@ d , and famous pieces of Romanian folklore by combin@@ ing the violin and guitar .
the ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ic project belongs to musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is named when violin Me@@ ets Gu@@ itar , according to HotNews.ro .
Florentin : &quot; we have found each other , and we have enjoyed very much since then playing together , having a virtually unlimited repertoire . &quot;
we thought that this is the moment when a violin met a guitar .
Cristi : &quot; from the first meeting we discovered that what we play sounds very good and that , in terms of the human component , things are working . &quot;
each of us learned the repertoire of the other under way and , what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments fit .
Florentin : &quot; I know there is a gap between the classical musicians and the rest . &quot;
I think many people can listen to classical music .
and secondly we can still play Queen , De@@ ep pur@@ ple , our old rock songs and of course , jazz .
we want to find the bridge between gen@@ res , we want to offer a kind of music that might make those who listen only to classical music listen also to rock music and those who listen only to rock music get to like classical music as well .
and we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that people never imagined they will hear something like that and that they might like it .
Cristi : &quot; when we find young people - and we find increasingly more - who know who Pink Flo@@ y@@ d was , it seems like a formidable thing for us . &quot;
students from Iasi spent more time in traffic than at school on the first day of school after the holiday
hundreds of Iasi citizens were &quot; tr@@ apped &quot; yesterday morning in the hel@@ l@@ ish traffic from several areas .
the City Hall announced today that Mang@@ er@@ on Bo@@ ul@@ evard ( Bah@@ lui street , left em@@ bank@@ ment ) will be closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Ros .
the heads of City Hall failed to achieve their promise to perform works for the smooth flow of road traffic with the on@@ set of the school year .
one of the assurances given by the municipality at least twice in recent weeks , was the rein@@ statement of the ro@@ und@@ about from the International Rail@@ way St@@ ation area .
although only a few interim elements had to be installed and the last deadline for the performance of the works was the past weekend , the ro@@ und@@ about was in@@ existent yesterday .
the drivers nerves were stret@@ ched to the maximum on Nicolae i@@ org@@ a and Cant@@ emir streets , given that another promise of the City Hall was broken : the transfer of the customs service from Nicolae i@@ org@@ a Street to Tehn@@ opolis &quot; no later than the end of August , &quot; although this transfer is discussed since 2012 .
currently , Ac@@ ting Mayor Michael Chirica says that the problem from the International Rail@@ way St@@ ation is more complicated .
the ro@@ und@@ about will be made at the appropriate time , we must consider the tr@@ ams traffic in the area , and we also need an approval from the National Roads .
&quot; it &apos;s not like Z@@ imbr@@ u where there is time for the tram to turn in the ro@@ und@@ about , but we will solve it somehow , &quot; said Chirica .
one solution , according to him , would be stopping the tram with a traffic light stop before the turn .
problems in traffic were also in the intersection of Podu Ros .
the car line on Sfantul Lazar Street stret@@ ched until the Romanian Secret Service headquarters .
&quot; I waited several minutes to get out of Podu Ros , &quot; said one of Iasi citizens .
in September the tr@@ ams should have passed on Podu Ros to C@@ UG if the rehabilitation project &quot; Development and Re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation of South Func@@ tional ar@@ tery &quot; was completed within the initial execution term ( July 31 , 2015 ) .
in that case , there are two projects which complement the initial one .
&quot; we have obtained European funding for new works , like an expansion , as the original version of Nicolina passage was too narrow &quot; commented Chirica .
the latest deadline for re@@ introducing tram traffic is October .
yesterday , people from Iasi reported traffic problems especially in areas like Pacur@@ ari , Center ( Targu Cucu , Independ@@ en@@ ț@@ ei , Armenian Street ) or the intersection of Base 3 .
Adomn@@ i@@ ț@@ ei could return as head of the County Council .
tomorrow we will know for sure .
the Court Judges will decide tomorrow whether the legal restrictions pending trial and prohib@@ itions of the suspended President of the County Council will be maintained .
the Magistr@@ ates of Iasi Court settled yesterday a new hearing in the &quot; Al@@ bum &quot; case in which the suspended President of Iasi County Council is also a party .
at the end of yesterday &apos;s hearing , the magistrates decided to give their resolution some@@ time tomorrow on the measure of the judicial review currently imposed against Adomn@@ i@@ ț@@ ei .
the latter wants the substitu@@ tion or revoc@@ ation of this measure , which has kept him away from the seat of head of the County Council for several months .
in case of a favourable solution and if it will be maintained by the superior court , Cristian Adomn@@ i@@ ț@@ ei may resume his position as the president of the County Council .
Adomn@@ i@@ ț@@ ei was indicted by the National Ant@@ icor@@ ruption Directorate ( DNA ) , being accused of favouring the off@@ ender and forgery after , according to the prosecutors , he tried to mask an audit which discovered a number of irregularities regarding the acceptance of a public contract entered into by the County Council and the company Las@@ er Co .
Adomn@@ i@@ ț@@ ei allegedly tried to hide the fact that the institution he managed had not accepted more materials to promote the Iasi county , although the records shows that these materials have been received by the County Council .
he is prosecuted with three Manag@@ ers of the County Council and the manager of the company Las@@ er Co .
other 3@@ 500 Iasi citizens are expected to vote until September 25th
the City Hall is prepared to distribute other surve@@ ys , if the 12,000 forms will be finished .
the people from Iasi have only ten days to express an opinion on the repl@@ anting of L@@ inde@@ n trees on Stefan cel Mare pedestrian crossing .
according to municipal officials , 8,@@ 500 of the 12,000 question@@ n@@ aires distributed to district centres and three additional points in the city ( Copou Park , Alexandru cel Bun Es@@ plan@@ ade and the City Hall ) have been filled out to date .
a record number of Iasi citizens came Sunday in front of the City Hall .
according to the representatives of the civic group &quot; I@@ a@@ ș@@ i loves L@@ inde@@ n trees , &quot; 5@@ 30 Iasi citizens voted in 140 minutes or almost four votes each minute .
instead , throughout Monday , about 440 Iasi citizens came in the same place .
group volunteers say that many Iasi citizens criticise the inefficient advertising and popular@@ iz@@ ation of public consultation .
therefore , they called yesterday to internet users to print an information poster provided by the group and stick it on building entr@@ ances .
volunteers also said that at the additional point in Copou park , the last forms were filled out by the people of Iasi on Sunday .
we will provide forms from the district centres , where not many are being filled out .
&quot; we will make further additions when all 12,000 forms will be filled out , &quot; the municipality spokesman Sebastian Bur@@ aga said yesterday .
&quot; the L@@ inde@@ n Survey &quot; will end on September 25 , and if the majority of the people of Iasi &apos;s vote is in favour of repl@@ anting the trees then the City Hall will plant silver l@@ ind@@ ens this fall .
the people from Iasi may express their opinion in the district centres of Dacia , Frum@@ oasa , T@@ ă@@ t@@ ă@@ ra@@ ș@@ i , Nicolina and P@@ ă@@ cur@@ ari , as well as in the additional points mentioned above .
the Heads of The City Hall decided the cutting of L@@ inde@@ n trees on Stefan cel Mare Street in early 2013 , an action that resulted in a fine of 60,000 lei for the municipality .
the decision was taken unilater@@ ally , without consultation with the population , and led to the spontaneous establishment of the civic group &quot; I@@ a@@ ș@@ i loves L@@ inde@@ n trees , &quot; an online community com@@ pris@@ ing approximately 13,@@ 500 people .
online , a petition initiated by the civic group for the repl@@ anting of L@@ inde@@ n trees was signed , until yesterday evening , by over 9,@@ 100 supporters .
record number of students enrolled at USA@@ M@@ V !
9@@ 20 students in the 1st year
the university has 9@@ 20 students enrolled in the first year .
the Representatives of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine &quot; Ion Ionescu de la Brad &quot; ( USA@@ M@@ V ) stated that this year were admitted more candidates than ever before in the history of the institution of higher education , since its establishment .
we are very pleased with the results of this year &apos;s admission .
we have the largest number of candidates ever admitted in the university &apos;s history , nearly 9@@ 20 students in the first year . we have never reached such a number .
&quot; we also had candidates with higher average marks and we filled our scholarships for the b@@ ach@@ elor &apos;s and Master &apos;s program@@ s &quot; said Pr@@ of . Ioan Ț@@ en@@ u , vice @-@ rector in charge of teaching .
he also said that the university has registered a considerable number of paying students , occupying 20 % of its seats , a figure significantly higher than in other years .
while the results of the Romanian language study program@@ s have been published , ad@@ missions still continue for the English program at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , who put up 50 seats and for which the fee is 5,000 Euro . officials are now waiting for a response from the ministry regarding the confirmation of students &apos; files and study visas required .
for the autumn session a total 120 files were submitted for the 14 scholarships and 20@@ 9 paid seats available for the b@@ ach@@ elor &apos;s program@@ s .
most files were submitted at the Faculty of Agriculture , 75 , 23 were submitted at the Faculty of H@@ ort@@ icul@@ ture and 22 at the Faculty of Anim@@ al hus@@ band@@ ry .
for the master &apos;s program , 18 files were submitted in the autumn session for the 150 paid seats proposed by USA@@ M@@ V , seven of which for Agriculture , five for H@@ ort@@ icul@@ ture and six for Anim@@ al hus@@ band@@ ry .
drivers fear their car wheels will get stuck in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge
the Bridge over Bah@@ lui on Tudor Vladimirescu Bo@@ ul@@ evard remained as full of depres@@ sions as when &quot; Ziarul de Iasi &quot; wrote about its problems 10 days ago .
our daily newspaper reporters presented at the time that the asphalt began to sink at the line demar@@ cat@@ ing the two lanes and deep cav@@ ities appeared , some even 20 centimetres deep , through which the concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge can be seen .
moreover , the asphalt started to crack on each side of the axis , and there are signs that the depres@@ sions will increase .
at the time , the acting mayor Mihai Chirica said that the bridge has no structural problems , a technical expertise being performed recently in order to start a project to reh@@ abilitate the bridge and tram rail , in the amount of 5 million euro .
mayor Chirica stated that the area affected by cracks and cav@@ ities will be sign@@ alled , and asphalt rehabilitation works will be performed soon .
but so far the only measure taken was the installation of some posts and a signalling lane , without even a simple filling .
during this period , we focused more on the opening of the school year and the works necessary for this purpose .
&quot; a punc@@ tual expertise of the bridge is under way which we expect to be ready in about a week with the necessary details for the intervention . I think that in no more than two weeks we could move on to recti@@ fy the situation &quot; said the Ac@@ ting Mayor .
at the beginning of the school year
yesterday , my el@@ dest son , Ș@@ t@@ ef@@ an , started school .
preparatory school year , as he attempts to improve the situation .
I do not know whether to re@@ jo@@ ice or let mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y overwhel@@ m me ; I pas@@ sively tend towards the latter .
firstly , I feel it &apos;s only been three weeks , not three years since I first took him to the kind@@ erg@@ art@@ en .
although reli@@ ev@@ ed , no normal parent feels joy that his children grow up .
secondly , because I perfectly remember the same day from my childhood ; it was then when a story began which , iron@@ ically , has not ended to this day .
I wasn &apos;t what you would usually call a con@@ scienti@@ ous student .
on the contrary , I would say .
but I always liked school .
so much that I chose to continue attending , even if as a teacher .
when I decided that &apos;s what I want to do my whole life , I knew it was not an easy job .
and it &apos;s not one where the stake is small .
that &apos;s because , like all of us , I myself encountered all kinds of teachers : better or worse , nice or ob@@ nox@@ ious , smar@@ ter or down@@ right idi@@ otic .
unfortunately , there are people with other cal@@ l@@ ings in this craft .
I think they are toxic because they violate the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to develop .
when I was a pup@@ il I was lucky to have a few exceptional teachers .
these en@@ coun@@ ters can be decisive if they happen at the appropriate time .
who believes that the role of the person behind the des@@ k is to triv@@ i@@ ally transmit information is entirely wrong .
this can be done by anyone ; any student can search from information by himself , we only live in the era of transparency .
a good teacher shap@@ es the mind of his students .
he forms them , he influences their way of thinking .
sitting behind the des@@ k is not a privilege , as a lot of people believe , but a great responsibility .
young people are very p@@ icky , demanding , unfor@@ giving and always willing to look for f@@ laws in those who are front of them .
their age and temper@@ ament demand it .
as teenagers , we all thought we knew everything , we had un@@ w@@ aver@@ ing certainty about anything .
when we grow up , we realiz@@ e that all we have is doubts .
therefore , the role of a teacher is to shake the teenager out of his categor@@ ical self @-@ suffici@@ ency and make him think .
that is to learn , to doubt , to ask questions .
to discover answers on their own , even if the answers are provisional .
to get involved in everything he does .
to discre@@ et@@ ly direct him towards profitable models .
it &apos;s very difficult , especially because the student often thinks the teacher is his enemy .
someone who is just waiting to catch him off guard and pen@@ aliz@@ e him .
this entit@@ les him , the etern@@ ally mis@@ understood , rebel@@ li@@ ous student , obliged to fully live the cal@@ l@@ ings of his age , to look with suspicion towards the person behind the des@@ k .
he can &apos;t naturally just accept the attempts to discipline him .
teenagers don &apos;t just let others place them in their place , they do not accept restrictions .
or , if they give the impression that they do , they somehow re@@ tal@@ iate .
and unfortunately , when a rigid person is behind the des@@ k who imposes respect through har@@ dness and does not communicate , students take ven@@ geance on the taught subject .
there are thousands of such adolesc@@ ents who miss en@@ counter@@ ing great writers , for instance , due to the lack of t@@ act of the Romanian teacher .
there are thousands of such students who think that history is a sequ@@ ence of data , that mathematics is all that can be more ti@@ ring for their im@@ mature minds .
I always urge my students : if you en@@ counter a teacher you cannot stand , who doesn &apos;t know how to communicate , do not let him get drive you away from literature . he should drive you towards it .
how did it happened that I myself became a teacher ?
I had a very good teacher in secondary school .
he opened my mind to some texts which spoke to the pu@@ bes@@ cent student and he understood .
in high school I also met a university professor who opened his library door to me .
I looked at him and saw man from another world : his house &apos;s walls were covered with shel@@ ves cr@@ am@@ med with books .
I lost myself in his library and dre@@ amed about ow@@ ning one myself .
now I do , but if fate had@@ n &apos;t crossed our paths , maybe I would have decided to become a football player .
or an engineer or a lawyer or who knows what .
I do not think such en@@ coun@@ ters are co@@ incident@@ al .
I do not believe in chance .
it is vital to b@@ ump into the man who is going to take you by the hand and lead you towards his own voc@@ ation .
that person is often the teacher .
now , my experience helps me to only talk about what it means to teach literature .
the only thing is that literature cannot be thought .
there is no such thing as a literature professor , as there is a math teacher .
how can you fix the in@@ eff@@ able in concepts ?
you can , at best , approxim@@ ate it , without claiming that you convey un@@ questionable truths .
the man behind the des@@ k can be a guide at most , telling you what to read . that &apos;s something else .
but above all , he can create the opportunity for some miracul@@ ous en@@ coun@@ ters between a reader and some books .
these are en@@ coun@@ ters that can change the life of the student .
these are en@@ counter that can open his mind , who can raise the sc@@ ales from his eyes , as someone once said .
therefore , the literature teacher should firstly make his students understand ( feel ) that between literature and life there can never be a divorce .
quite the contrary !
a great convers@@ ation@@ alist , Alexandru Pal@@ e@@ olog@@ u states something that is apparently paradox@@ ical : &quot; the more literature there is , the more life exists , not the other way around ! &quot; , and he was right .
therefore , a good teacher prepares you for life , he does not make you a specialist in a field which is open anyway .
fortunately , we have always something to learn .
us teachers too ; or better said mostly us , the teachers .
most times , a great truth only repe@@ ats itself due to iner@@ tia : not only do discipl@@ es have something to learn from their masters , but also vice versa .
ide@@ ally , the teacher should be a master and the student an ap@@ pren@@ tice .
as any successful young man , he leaves his master when he disc@@ ov@@ ers his own path .
the truth is that few of them find it .
but the master was the one who lit the spar@@ k .
I do not think there is greater happiness for a thor@@ ough@@ b@@ red teacher than to end@@ ure as many such separ@@ ations as possible .

the FIFA investigation is extended
the justice system in the US and Switzerland will conduct new arrests
us and Swiss authorities have announced they would open formal criminal investigations of new individuals and organiz@@ ations in the investigation referring to the FIFA corruption scandal , inform@@ s the international media .
U.@@ S. attorney general Lo@@ ret@@ ta Lyn@@ ch announced on Monday in a press conference in Zurich , that the scope of the investigations regarding the corruption in the football world has been expanded .
&quot; based on our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence , we will conduct additional pros@@ ecuti@@ ons against some new individuals and organiz@@ ations , &quot; said Lyn@@ ch .
in May , several senior members of FIFA were arrested in Switzerland as part of this corruption case .
many of them have already been extrad@@ ited to the US .
&quot; we hope that other prosecuted individual will be extrad@@ ited to the US , &quot; added Lyn@@ ch .
the attorney general of Switzerland , Michael Lau@@ ber , also present at the press conference , said that his institution has seized several properties , including houses and land in the Al@@ ps , as well as financial assets as part of the investigation carried out in conjunction with the USA .
&quot; we haven &apos;t even reached the end of the first half yet , &quot; said Lau@@ ber .

the ri@@ der was not noticed by the driver .
fortunately , both have a stable condition .
following the impact , the car &apos;s wind@@ shield and mirror were broken .
two injured individuals are un@@ con@@ sc@@ ious at the time of transmission of this news .

a Syrian artist turned &quot; Super Mario &quot; into a refugee
a Syrian artist has created a refugee version of the popular game &quot; Super Mario , &quot; evo@@ king the predic@@ ament of his countr@@ ymen on their way to Europe .
instead of presenting the advent@@ ures of Italian pl@@ um@@ ber Mario in the mush@@ room Kingdom , the modified video game centres around &quot; refugee Mario . &quot;
the character attempts to pass human smug@@ glers and then border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union .
the artist settled now in Istanbul uses the pseud@@ on@@ y@@ m Sam@@ ir al @-@ Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game centred around refugee Mario after his friends vent@@ ured into a per@@ il@@ ous journey to Europe to escape the horr@@ ors of war .
in Craiova Det@@ ention Centre , the youngest student is 15 years old and he is in the 1st grade
the Minister of Justice Robert Cazanciuc stated at the opening of the school year at Craiova Det@@ ention Centre that the youngest student is 15 years old and that he is in the 1st grade , and the oldest is 25 years old and in the X@@ I@@ th grade . he also added that that they could have had another life if they had gone to school .
I chose to attend the opening of the school year in one of the National Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Administration &apos;s Cent@@ res to draw the attention on some less@@ er known facts .
the youngest student , aged 15 , is enrolled in the 1st grade and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in the X@@ I@@ th grade .
&quot; there are complicated subjects which society is keen to discuss at this time , we are all op@@ pressed by our own wor@@ ries and problems , but we should not over@@ look the lesson that these 100 young people from Craiova Det@@ ention Centre offer , &quot; said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday at the opening ceremony of the school year .
the Minister of Justice pointed out that lack of education , motivated in many cases by the lack of financial resources , can lead to tragedy , stating that the youth in this centre might have had another chance in life if they had followed the natural school course of every child , if they had the opportunity to learn not only how to write , to read , but also to receive a set of moral values , to find out what it means to abide by the law and the consequences of not doing so .
&quot; the role of the prison system is not to permanently isol@@ ate from society the people who break the law , to im@@ prison them behind high walls , but to try to re @-@ educate and prepare them so that when they return into community they have more chances of reintegration &quot; added Cazanciuc .
the minister said it is necessary to invest in schools , hospitals , and roads , but investments must also be made in the prison system because in many cases , the imprisonment conditions are at the limit of humanity and if there is a lack of money and personnel , it will be difficult to speak of reintegration of convicted persons .
we work very well with the Ministry of Education and through this partnership , every year , over 2000 people in the prison system graduate school training courses .
obviously , we will not change overnight what has not been done in 25 years , but we have made great str@@ ides .
&quot; for all these efforts we also need the support of society , and this support cannot come unless we prove that we do our duty , that through your work these teenagers have an opportunity and do not pose a threat to society &quot; said Cazanciuc .
the Minister of Justice wished both the students and educ@@ ators good luck , showing that success comes only through the combined efforts of all the parties involved .
&quot; and because today is the F@@ east of the Ex@@ alt@@ ation of the Cross , I would like to invite all students and teachers to visit the ma@@ us@@ ole@@ ums of S@@ ov@@ e@@ ja , M@@ ă@@ r@@ ă@@ ș@@ ti , among other objectives , to understand what the young people &apos;s fight for ideals means , &quot; stated Robert Cazanciuc .

doctoral schools caught with more than two plag@@ iaries to be dis@@ solved !
petition of prestigious academic persons from Iasi and the rest of the country
over 200 researchers , academ@@ ics , staff and students in the country have signed a petition launched by the Academic Society of Romania in which they request the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research , to evaluate , sanction and even dis@@ solve the Romanian doctoral schools &quot; which allow and promote academic im@@ post@@ ure . &quot;
the signatories of the petition launched on September 10 include teachers and professors in Iasi .
among the academ@@ ics who have signed the petition from the academic field of Iasi , is Pr@@ of . Liviu Anton@@ esei , PhD .
nation@@ ally , the petition was signed by former ministers of Education , such as Mircea Mic@@ lea , liter@@ ati who are also university professors such as Andrei Plesu , Aur@@ ora Li@@ iceanu or Alina Mungiu @-@ Pip@@ p@@ idi .
&quot; although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools , this has not been done so far , resulting in a lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools flagr@@ antly violating ethical standards of scientific research and which do not produce relevant and internationally recogn@@ iz@@ ed performance &quot; is stated in the petition .
in the said petition it is specifically required the compliance with the National Education Law , the evaluation of doctoral schools and suspension of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plag@@ iaries are found , until the assessment and remedy of the situation .
the last requirement is the suspension of operation for any doctoral school where the minimum number of scientific advis@@ ors provided by law who meet the criteria of the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility to I@@ DE@@ A type projects grants does not exist .
do you respect less a general without a PhD , or a politician , or an intelligence agent in the Middle East ?
&quot; why are there not in Europe other academ@@ ies which have PhD organiz@@ ed by secret services ? and why do top military members who obtain their PhD do this in autonomous institutions , where the quality is verified by academ@@ ics ? &quot; stated Alina Mungiu @-@ Pip@@ p@@ idi , president of the Romanian Academic Society , initiator of the petition , who also comes from Iasi .
this can be filled in by all interested parties on the website of the Society , and the final signatures will be submitted by the organiz@@ ation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research .
we are not looking for 3 men with money , but 10,000 men who want to get involved .
the &quot; Pentru Iasi &quot; party , founded by young IT managers with no political affili@@ ations , made its debut the day before yesterday in Copou Park .
the chairman of the &quot; Pentru Iasi &quot; Initiative Group gave an interview to &quot; Ziarul de Iasi &quot;
Iasi will have a party exclusively dedicated to the development of the city .
a group of entrepreneurs and managers with no political affili@@ ations established the For Iasi party last week , an organiz@@ ation which will propose candidates in the local elections of 2016 .
currently , the core of the party consists of IT specialists , but the founder of the he party says that the organiz@@ ation welcomes all the individuals who want to be involved in the modern@@ iz@@ ation of the city .
the party was announced on Saturday in Copou park , and the event was attended by over 200 supporters , nearly all of them being young people .
the special guest of the event was Nic@@ u@@ ș@@ or Dan , the president of Salv@@ a@@ ț@@ i Bucure@@ ș@@ tiul Association .
he was the surprise of the local elections in 2012 when , as an independent candidate , he managed to obtain 10 % of the votes of Bucharest &apos;s citizens in the race for mayor .
&quot; I think the people in the &quot; Pentru Iasi &quot; party are very adequate to be appointed in the public administration of Iasi . &quot;
I believe in this initiative , I think is has a chance for success , and I think it is better suited for a smaller community than that of Bucharest .
&quot; I will always support &quot; Pentru Iasi &quot; &quot; said Dan Nic@@ u@@ ș@@ or .
Z@@ DI : why haven &apos;t you left Iasi to work in an IT company from abroad ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : my reasons are rather sentim@@ ental and emotional .
I was away in many short business trips , I have also lived in Cluj for a year .
I have always come back , because I felt that this is my home .
Z@@ DI : why did you decide to start a political party ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : we &apos;ve reached a certain maturity , we are a group of people who got to know each other for a while .
we met in a professional context and began discussing ways in which we could get involved .
in the beginning , our involvement was a little sh@@ y , we got engaged in smaller projects , with NGOs , various municipal or char@@ itable actions , and somehow things evolved naturally and organ@@ ically and now we happened to decide that we need to get involved more .
Z@@ DI : name three concrete projects to stream@@ line the local public administration !
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : the first project consists of a minimum inform@@ atiz@@ ation of the City Hall activities so that the various departments , institutions and administrations are able to better cooperate .
but , more importantly , to be able to publish transparent data about the detailed activities : budgets , reports , projects , etc . we are talking about information organiz@@ ation .
the second project would be transparency because it leads to efficiency .
if you have a project in a particular neighbourhood , it is important to public@@ ally consult the affected people .
if we are talking about efficiency , we must not forget public transportation . we have the worst bus@@ ses in the country .
we must purchase new means of transportation .
Z@@ DI : today , a city &apos;s image is very important .
how would you promote Iasi ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : you board a plane and search for investors .
there are conferences , industry events where you can &quot; sell &quot; the city .
you have to want to do it and know how to do it .
and here we have an advantage : our background is business and we have brought customers to Iasi .
what is the brand of Iasi ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : in my opinion , this city needs to be technological , in one way or another .
we already have the IT industry and we need to expand it , to get involved in medicine , robot@@ ics , 3D printing , to continue in this spirit and merge these elements .
I think the brand should be in the area of science , and I &apos;m referring to the modern brand of the city .
of course , Iasi &apos;s brand is already history , and it should not be changed . Iasi should remain a cultural city .
I see two elements in balance : culture and technology .
Z@@ DI : how will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration , as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : the administration is a form of management which means organiz@@ ation , planning , communication , working with people and developing projects .
we have experience in management .
we do not want traditional structures , we are not interested in those .
we want to involve the people . we will talk to everyone , and we do not intend to remain present only on Facebook . we &apos;re not an online party .
we do not want &quot; volunteers &quot; who were forced into buses and brought to us .
that means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help , and we believe that there are enough people like this .
Z@@ DI : should the mayor of Iasi be more concerned with the national and international promotion of the city , or is it necessary for the scope of the concerns to be continuously municipal in nature ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : you can &apos;t have one without the other , it will not work .
the first things that you need to solve are the problems of the day , the emerg@@ encies .
or , if you do not make your city known , if you do not draw money to the city , at some point you are going to run out of money and you won &apos;t be able to build streets for example .
you need both things simultaneously and you need competent people around you .
the mayor shoul@@ dn &apos;t do everything .
we must give up the chief / mayor model who driv@@ es his f@@ ist through the wall and sol@@ ves everything .
no .
we are a team .
the mayor is the coordin@@ ator of an orchestra .
Z@@ DI : will you try to attract business men from the IT industry to the party to financially support the organisation ?
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache : we are seeking people who want to do something good , to have a spot@@ less reputation , to have integrity and honour .
from this point of view , we have no other filters .
we are not looking for three men with money , we &apos;re looking for 10,000 men , or , why not , 300,000 men who want to get involved and do something for the town .
interview by Alex Andrei
Andrei Post@@ ol@@ ache has been working in the IT industry for nearly 15 years .
in July 2015 he founded Intr@@ osp@@ eci@@ als . before this was a director of the En@@ d@@ ava international concern for seven years ( 2008 to 2015 ) , where he led a team of 300 people .
he spent another four years ( 2003 - 2007 ) at Syn@@ y@@ gy .
the company that he founded along with another IT specialist provides management consulting services .
the Tr@@ actor &quot; sc@@ rap@@ page &quot; Program , a failure
the General Manager of SC IR@@ UM SA Reg@@ hin , Mircea Oltean , said that the program to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural machinery , initiated in 2011 , also called the Tr@@ actor sc@@ rap@@ page Program , was a failure due to bureaucracy .
regarding the sc@@ rap@@ page program , there were some attempts in recent years , but it turned out to be a failure , because the documentation was very labor@@ ious and complicated for an ordinary farmer and the approv@@ als took too long , so people gave up .
through that program about 10 pieces were sold .
&quot; the need of tractors for the Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces , &quot; said Mircea Oltean .
according to him , IR@@ UM Reg@@ hin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually , being the largest company of this kind in Romania , and that greater competition is exercised by foreign companies , who know the Romanian market needs .
it is a huge competition with those coming from abroad , all global manufacturers have set their sights on Romania , I know what I am saying , and they have special policies .
&quot; there is huge Cr@@ am at all the fairs , all the manufacturers come with all sorts of vari@@ ations &quot; said Mircea Oltean , who said that IR@@ UM Reg@@ hin manufac@@ tures around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors a year .
through the Tr@@ actor sc@@ rap@@ page Program , initiated in 2011 , those who own old tractors or other self @-@ prop@@ elled means of transport , such as harvest@@ ers , could hand them over and receive in exchange a vouch@@ er for 17@@ ,000 lei .
the red flag has been risen
the internal ballot of the Labour Party looks spectacular and politically significant , particularly as the newly elected leader is automatically sp@@ ear@@ heading in the upcoming election .
then raise the scar@@ let standard high / bene@@ ath its fol@@ ds we &apos;ll live and die
that is what yesterday Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n sang in the London pu@@ b sanc@@ t@@ uary House .
it witnessed many a de@@ ed and vo@@ w / We must not change its colour now
readers who are not familiar with the mel@@ ody of this un@@ official British and international lef@@ tist anthem ( The Red F@@ lag ) can search the Internet they might have a surprise .
with heads unc@@ overed swe@@ ar we all / To b@@ are it on@@ ward t@@ ill we fall
the author of these lines is not a fan of red flags ( or of f@@ la@@ unting flags ) , but respects the democratic political traditions built around them .
if Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will be able to unite yesterday left with tomorrow left , this love story between him and the basis of the Labour Party will have a happy ending .
I do not think it would happen so , but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat five years from now , of a leader who was elected yesterday .
now , however , we can make reference to the procedures : we have witnessed a democratic exercise at an impressive scale .
the direct voting system was not invented by the Labour Party among the Western left for their leader .
French soci@@ alists have been practic@@ ing a more complicated system based on motion for several years . this system allows all members and supporters to express themselves ; In addition , they held a preliminary competition for the 2012 nomination of the presidential candidate .
however , the internal ballot of the Labour Party looks spectacular and politically significant , particularly as the newly elected leader is automatically sp@@ ear@@ heading in the upcoming election .
this is of course also a political system matter , the person@@ aliz@@ ation of power is more pronounced in the UK than on the other side of the English Channel .
in addition , voter turnout was high in all three &quot; circles &quot; : the actual members , union members and other organiz@@ ations affiliated to the party , and finally , the group of sympath@@ iz@@ ers ( who received the ballot paper after a brief registration procedure ) .
the latter group gives us interesting information about the percep@@ tions of the left segments of the British society , especially those made of young or middle @-@ aged educated individuals , interested in the political phenomenon .
many will choose to be involved further in the future because of the signal provided by Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s victory .
as far as I know , there are no soci@@ ological surve@@ ys that tell us much about the attitudes of the Labour Party &apos;s &quot; ou@@ ter circle &quot; so cautious speculation is permitted .
I think we can find enough attitudes similar to those of Po@@ demos ( Spain ) or even S@@ Y@@ RI@@ Z@@ A ( Greece ) supporters , noting that they will go through the traditional channels of the left .
if we really want to identify an &quot; anti @-@ system &quot; voc@@ ation , it is primarily reflected by the rejection of the centr@@ ist line , New Labour ( for many , a disguised form of the much abused Th@@ at@@ cher@@ ism ) .
the second component would be the re@@ pu@@ di@@ ation of leaders who are considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures , one of the arguments being that did they were not lef@@ tist enough , not being firmly de@@ line@@ ated from the Tony Blair era .
the second reference frame - in my opinion , which is more suggest@@ ive - is offered by the recent referendum for independence in Scotland .
ignoring the separatist message and strictly focusing on the aspirations on other political issues , we see that Scottish nation@@ alists have captured the energy of audience segments which are favourable for social status and animated by the aspir@@ ation of fairness . the audience are the followers of dis@@ armament and hostile to military involvement abroad , but also sensitive to the new fears of the left : ecology , gender , support of the poor countries .
thus , the Scottish Labour Party has lost an electorate that should have privileged access , at least in principle , but who can now be recovered ( see their enthusiasm in campaign &apos;s Cor@@ by@@ n ) .
such energy can be found everywhere in the UK , but the old leadership has not been able to attract it .
with the voc@@ ation of an out@@ sider , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n has more chances of success than Ed Mil@@ ib@@ and , the Labour Party &quot; ar@@ ist@@ ocr@@ at . &quot;
I believe the comparison with Scotland tells us more than the one with the anti @-@ system left in Europe &apos;s southern peripher@@ y .
the term &quot; anti @-@ system &quot; is too harsh : &quot; anti @-@ establishment &quot; seems more appropriate .
by next week we would have learned more about the first steps of Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n as the leader of the opposition .
we will see whether the red flag will res@@ onate in the House of Comm@@ ons ( it would not be the first time ) , after the new leader will be ranked in the first row of the opposition .
however , what Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n wants right now from his colleagues in the Parliament is primarily unity - and in this respect he really has a reason to be worried .
the manipulation trap with or without deliberate knowledge
while I was writing the article it occurred to me to check the internet for the story of the ex @-@ militant and &quot; Syrian rebel commander La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh &quot; who became &quot; jihadists La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh &quot; in the second part of the article dedicated to him by V . Marin ( the two categor@@ iz@@ ations - &quot; rebel &quot; and &quot; jihadist &quot; - could have made me cautious from the start ) .
I didn &apos;t check .
in last week &apos;s article ( Europe , between refugees and &quot; refugees &quot; ) I commented these two pictures in parallel - one depic@@ ting little A@@ ylan Kur@@ di who was found dead on the shores of the Mediterranean and one , actually two : depic@@ ting Syrian La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh one as a fighter , the other as a refugee .
I took over the story of La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh from the &quot; Syrian fighters mixed among the refugees &quot; article ( by Viorica Marin , published in the Adevarul issue of September 3 ) .
on Monday evening , I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page .
on Tuesday , once I log@@ ged in to my Facebook account , I found , among other things , a sc@@ old@@ ing comment from my friend ( also in real life ) Cristian : &quot; I subscri@@ be . I only have one remark : La@@ ith al Sal@@ eh is not a jihadist . &quot;
on the contrary , he f@@ ights against Al Assad , for democracy ... and so on .
&quot; so you could have also mentioned the gross manipulation from the image &quot; !
I must admit , it suc@@ ked .
the more so as that , while I was writing the article it occurred to me to check the internet for the story of the ex @-@ militant and &quot; Syrian rebel commander La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh &quot; who became &quot; jihadists La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh &quot; in the second part of the article dedicated to him by V . Marin ( the two categor@@ iz@@ ations - &quot; rebel &quot; and &quot; jihadist &quot; - could have made me cautious from the start ) .
this happened because I tr@@ usted Adevarul and its journalists .
still , I didn &apos;t have anything to comment to the sc@@ old@@ ing of Marius Cristian other than : &quot; this is what I get for trust@@ ing ( having tr@@ usted ) Adevarul &quot;
after that , I obviously began to study the story closely and I feel indeb@@ ted to the readers , ow@@ ing them a fair presentation of the story of Syrian La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh .
the oldest information I could find was a story by the Associated Press ( Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe ) signed by Nicholas B@@ aph@@ itis and D@@ alt@@ on Ben@@ net@@ t of 17 August 2015 , about a man on the island of Kos in Greece , where he was noticed among hundreds , maybe thousands of refugees , who was trying to bring order to the chaos of the crowd .
the man was the Syrian La@@ ith Al Sal@@ eh from Alep . he &quot; is used to being in control , &quot; since he &quot; led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria . &quot;
I also found out that Al Sal@@ eh , aged 30 , had &quot; a house , a wife and a normal life before the fighting began . the war ended over 250,000 lives and left one third of Syria &apos;s population homeless . &quot;
in the interview given to the Associated Press correspond@@ ents , Al Sal@@ eh says that &quot; everyone wants to leave Syria . &quot;
my city is the most dangerous city in the world .
about 70 % of the city is in ruins .
in Syria , I am wanted by Al Qaeda , Daesh ( an extremist group of the Islamic State ) , the government - I have fought against them all .
beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island , it seems Kos offered him &quot; an even more sin@@ ister en@@ counter - a man in which he recogn@@ iz@@ ed a Syrian enemy &quot; : &quot; two days ago , I saw a sniper from the government forces . &quot;
I did not talk to him , but I &apos;m still very upset .
the article also tells us that La@@ ith ( meaning lion in Arabic ) was indeed on his way to Hol@@ land , to one of his c@@ ous@@ ins - a former senior officer in the Syrian army who also became a rebel and reached the West after being seriously injured - hoping to obtain asylum and eventually bring his family - his wife and a three year old boy ( almost as old as the civil war in Syria , which broke out in March 2011 ) .
once he manages to do this , we can &apos;t rule out that La@@ ith Al @-@ Sal@@ eh is going to return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army ( supported by the West ) - against three forces : the army of President Bashar Assad ( backed by Russia ) , the Islamic State and the n@@ us@@ ra Front , an Al @-@ Qaeda affili@@ ate .
it &apos;s crazy - those who want freedom in Syria must fight against three enemies , not one !
I also came across a Serbian article from August 22 , of which I did not understand much , just that La@@ ith Sal@@ eh is associated with terrorists that are mixed among the migrants : &quot; TER@@ OR@@ IS@@ TI SE K@@ RI@@ J@@ U ME@@ Đ@@ U MI@@ G@@ R@@ AN@@ T@@ IM@@ A &quot; is the title of a news article from http : / / www.@@ tel@@ egr@@ af@@ .@@ rs / V@@ esti , in which I found a picture of the be@@ ar@@ ded Al Sal@@ eh holding a Syrian flag in his hand and one of him as a refugee wearing that &quot; TH@@ AN@@ K you &quot; shirt .
on 7 September , on the BBC website , Mike W@@ end@@ ling drew attention to the case of manipulation in which pictures of the Syrian fighter are used : this viral photo fal@@ s@@ ely claims to show an IS fighter posing as a refugee .
we find out that the picture ( actually : pictures - the one in which La@@ ith has a be@@ ard and a gun and the one with the TH@@ AN@@ K you shirt ) was published by a user on Facebook . that user allegedly apolog@@ iz@@ ed in the meantime .
but before this happened , just from his Facebook wall the image containing the two pictures was shared over 70,000 times , getting thousands of comments .
thus the saying : too late , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
in Romania , on September 9 , Carla Dinu of Hotnews pic@@ ks up the manipulation story from BBC , although the title is err@@ one@@ ously translated : &quot; a fake photo which has become viral shows an ISIS fighter posing as a refugee . &quot;
obviously , the picture is not a fake , but the interpretation was false , wrong , in short : manipul@@ ative .
