the federal prosecutor &apos;s office said Jose D@@ ir@@ ce@@ u will face trial on the corruption , r@@ ack@@ et@@ e@@ ering and money laundering charges filed earlier this month .
four@@ teen other people will also be tried , including Jo@@ ao V@@ acc@@ ari Ne@@ to , the former treas@@ ure@@ r of Brazil &apos;s governing Workers &apos; Party and Renato de Sou@@ za Du@@ que , Petr@@ obr@@ as &apos; former head of corporate services .

&apos;@@ Mir@@ acul@@ ous &apos; recovery for Pes@@ ha@@ war massacre scho@@ ol@@ boy
a teenager paralysed after being shot four times in Pakistan &apos;s dead@@ liest terror attack has made a &quot; miracul@@ ous &quot; recovery following treatment in the UK .
Muhammad Ibrahim Khan , 13 , had been told by doctors in Pakistan that he would never walk again .
at least 140 people , mostly children , were killed when gunmen stormed Pes@@ ha@@ war &apos;s Army Public School last December .
Muhammad , who arrived in London last month for surgery , is being dis@@ charged from hospital later .
exactly nine months ago , on an ordinary Tuesday morning , Muhammad sat in his first aid class listening to his teachers int@@ ently .
at the same time seven gunmen disguised in security uni@@ forms were entering the Army Public School .
they were str@@ apped with explosives and had one simple mission in mind : kill every man , woman and child they came across .
&quot; I can &apos;t forget what happened that day , &quot; Muhammad says with a severe stare .
we were sitting in the aud@@ itor@@ ium , we were asking questions ... and then we heard heavy gun@@ fire outside .
the terrorists moved inside and they started killing - our teacher was burned alive .
Muhammad described pul@@ ling four other pupils out of the aud@@ itor@@ ium as the carn@@ age un@@ fol@@ ded .
he said he then heard his friend , Ham@@ za calling to him .
he said , &apos; oh brother save me &apos; .
I held his hand .
that &apos;s when I was shot in the back , and he was shot in the head .
most of the people killed in the attack were pupils
Ham@@ za died in Muhammad &apos;s arms .
Muhammad recalled bl@@ ac@@ king out after that , and the next thing he knew he was in a hospital bed , paralysed from the wa@@ ist down .
doctors in Pes@@ ha@@ war in northern Pakistan , and then R@@ aw@@ alp@@ ind@@ i , close to the capital , told his family there was no treatment , and he would never walk again .
&quot; seeing him I felt like my soul had left my body , &quot; says Muhammad &apos;s father , S@@ her Khan
those nine months were the hardest in my life .
but Mr Khan and his wife , Sher@@ ban@@ o , refused to believe that their cr@@ ick@@ et @-@ mad son would never be able to use his legs again .
they campa@@ igned , and appealed for help on Pakistani TV , gaining the support of high profile people such as cr@@ ick@@ eter turned politician Im@@ ran Khan .
finally , they were able to raise the funds to bring Muhammad to the UK and provide him with treatment at London &apos;s private Har@@ ley Street Clinic .
consultant neur@@ os@@ urg@@ eon Ir@@ fan M@@ ali@@ k described Muhammad as &quot; terri@@ fied &quot; when he first arrived at the hospital .
&quot; he &apos;@@ d spent the last &#91; few &#93; months lying on a bed , unable to move side to side , &quot; says Mr M@@ ali@@ k .
he was weak , he had a pressure s@@ ore on his back .
he wasn &apos;t in great shape .
a verte@@ bra at the base of Muhammad &apos;s sp@@ ine was destroyed
Muhammad was shot in his shoulder , his hip , and his back during the attack , damaging his lower sp@@ ine - leading to paral@@ ysis .
but during six hours of surgery , Mr M@@ ali@@ k and his team were able to re@@ att@@ ach nerve end@@ ings and re@@ construct the damaged part of the sp@@ ine .
even Mr M@@ ali@@ k was surprised at what happened next .
exactly one week after the surgery Muhammad stood up and started taking steps and walking .
we were not expecting to get that sort of excellent result .
that was miracul@@ ous , &quot; he says .
less than two weeks after his operation , Muhammad is ready to leave hospital and start the long road to recovery .
Muhammad has de@@ fied the od@@ ds and started to walk again
he says he wants to build his strength and continue his education in the UK .
but he says he is determined to return to Pakistan , join the army and help fight terrorism .
&quot; I feel like I have a second chance at life , &quot; he says as he shows off pictures he &apos;s drawn of guns scrib@@ bled out next to school books and pen@@ s
Muhammad grows physically stronger every day but the psychological trauma he continues to end@@ ure is un@@ imagin@@ able .
&quot; my anger is not dimin@@ ishing &quot; he says .
in my school little k@@ ids were killed .
what was their crime ?
his mother , wi@@ ping a tear from her eye , ca@@ res@@ sed his head and said : &quot; I can see my son walking again . &quot;
he &apos;ll be able to get on with his normal life .

Steven Wilson : &apos; if I don &apos;t do anything , I feel this cre@@ eping guil@@ t@@ &apos;
Steven Wilson was recently the big winner at the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson is often dubbed the hardest working musician in the world of progressive rock .
the multi @-@ talented musician won three prizes at this month &apos;s Progressive Music Awards in London , including album of the year for H@@ and .
the Guardian &apos;s five @-@ star review called it &quot; a smart , so@@ ul@@ ful and im@@ mer@@ sive work of art . &quot;
since the 1980s , Wilson has been the driving force in a number of musical projects , the best known of which is the rock band Por@@ cup@@ ine T@@ ree .
now , ahead of two sell @-@ out shows at the Royal Albert Hall , Wilson is rele@@ asing a vin@@ yl @-@ only double L@@ P , tran@@ si@@ ence , to show@@ case the &quot; more accessible &quot; side of his solo output .
he tells the BBC about his love of vin@@ yl , his busy schedule and explains how com@@ ic actor Matt Berry came to be his support act .
what does vin@@ yl mean to you ?
I grew up at the very tail end of the vin@@ yl era , and at the time , I remember , we co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t wait for CD to come along because vin@@ yl was so frustr@@ ating .
you would buy the record , take it home , and it would have a scratch , and you would have to take it back again .
I love CD@@ s , and for some kinds of music - classical for example - it is better than vin@@ yl .
but the problem with the CD and digital down@@ lo@@ ads is that there &apos;s nothing you can really cher@@ ish or treasure .
ow@@ ning vin@@ yl is like having a beautiful painting hanging in your living room .
it &apos;s something you can hold , por@@ e over the lyrics and im@@ mer@@ se yourself in the art work .
I thought it was just a nostalg@@ ic thing , but it can &apos;t be if k@@ ids too young to remember vin@@ yl are enjoying that kind of experience .
do you have a piece of vin@@ yl that you treasure ?
the truth is I got rid of 100 % of my vin@@ yl in the 9@@ 0s .
all the vin@@ yl I have is re @-@ bought .
I started off from the perspective that I wanted to recre@@ ate the collection I had when I was 15 , but it &apos;s gone beyond that .
the first record which I persuaded my parents to buy for me was Electric L@@ ight Orchestra &apos;s Out of the Blue .
if I still had my original copy , it would have sentim@@ ental value , but , al@@ as , it &apos;s in a charity shop somewhere .
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a do@@ or@@ way for potential new fans
why release your new comp@@ il@@ ation tran@@ si@@ ence on vin@@ yl ?
it was originally conceived as an idea for Rec@@ ord Store Day , but we missed the boat on that .
my record company had suggested I put together some of my shorter , more accessible songs .
I got a bit ob@@ s@@ essed by the idea to make something like &quot; an introduction to Steven Wilson , &quot; and I was committed to it being a vin@@ yl @-@ only release .
anyone who bu@@ ys the vin@@ yl does also get a high @-@ resolution download .
do you have a concern that the album won &apos;t show your work in a true light ?
