UN Chief S@@ ays Th@@ ere Is No Military S@@ olution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.@@ S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l N@@ um@@ bers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a f@@ li@@ p @-@ Fl@@ op@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an impl@@ osion .
but no matter how some Republ@@ ic@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from at@@ op the polls , it h@@ asn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gul &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
p@@ und@@ its point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Jeb Bush &apos;s Super p@@ ac and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogn@@ iz@@ ing Trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to top@@ ple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gul isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
tr@@ ump &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 per@@ cent .
in early August , it was 52 per@@ cent .
now , six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans have a favor@@ able view of Donald Trump .
r@@ oughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ n@@ ipi@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 per@@ cent of Republ@@ ic@@ ans there had a favor@@ able view of Trump .
two @-@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Trump as the nomin@@ ee .
in a CNN / O@@ RC poll last week , 67 per@@ cent of Republ@@ ic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trump were the nomin@@ ee .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the nomin@@ ee .
only Ben Carson generates r@@ oughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 per@@ cent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs . 40 per@@ cent who say the same of Trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per@@ cent .
on the f@@ li@@ p side , 47 per@@ cent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nomin@@ ee .
a majority of Republ@@ ic@@ ans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Trump has been widely critic@@ iz@@ ed for his bomb@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 per@@ cent of le@@ an@@ ed Republican voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gul has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation cauc@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 per@@ cent of Republ@@ ic@@ ans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ n@@ ipi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 per@@ cent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their P@@ und@@ it hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nomination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CNN / O@@ RC poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ op voters haven &apos;t had the clea@@ rest cr@@ ystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans pic@@ ked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 per@@ cent for eventual nomin@@ ee Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a plur@@ ality of G@@ O@@ P voters see Trump &apos;s campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if Republ@@ ic@@ ans ral@@ lied around another candidate , Trump still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some p@@ und@@ its point out that the spl@@ int@@ ered field is likely contributing to Trump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Trump support is be spread dif@@ fus@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads Car@@ ly F@@ ior@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Ru@@ bio by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Jeb Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ and Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cr@@ uz .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a b@@ are majority of Donald Trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 per@@ cent said they are leaving the door open to swit@@ ching candidates .
still , Trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ sider neur@@ os@@ urg@@ eon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rapists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and cent@@ er in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that Trump &apos;s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial H@@ is@@ panic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climb@@ ing to new high@@ s .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for r@@ oughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ sider status .
six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans in Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll say they want a political out@@ sider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Republ@@ ic@@ ans are frustrated with Republ@@ ic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per@@ cent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per@@ cent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awaited
new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six all@@ ot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrutin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could sk@@ ip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the en@@ counter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s New@@ s@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Robin Br@@ ant says policy differences are also &quot; stac@@ king up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 2@@ 6,000 to £ 2@@ 3,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the desp@@ atch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Isl@@ ing@@ ton North MP has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both &quot; re@@ part@@ ee &quot; and trading barb@@ s , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eag@@ le , the shadow business secretary , will depu@@ ti@@ se for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Comm@@ ons Speaker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; punc@@ h and Jud@@ y &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ om@@ eter of a leader &apos;s judg@@ ement , their command of the Comm@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caric@@ ature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ina@@ kis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ina@@ kis deserves k@@ u@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ ina@@ kis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ g@@ ios and deserves k@@ u@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ k@@ ina@@ kis , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the &quot; Special ks , &quot; was dragged into an un@@ welcome spotlight by the in@@ famous Kyr@@ g@@ ios sl@@ edge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after , Kok@@ k@@ ina@@ kis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair um@@ pire , with Harrison declar@@ ing : &quot; Wawrinka should &apos;ve dec@@ ked Kyr@@ g@@ ios , and I should dec@@ k that k@@ id . &quot;
while he was last seen s@@ mas@@ hing a r@@ acqu@@ et after cr@@ amp fo@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ ina@@ kis has been defended sta@@ unch@@ ly by He@@ aly .
the teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I do feel quite ke@@ en@@ ly about is I think Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s been dragged into the fr@@ ay a little bit , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he did break a r@@ acqu@@ et when he lost when he cr@@ amp@@ ed in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a r@@ acqu@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he h@@ asn &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the loc@@ ker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young gu@@ y and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also backed the decision to over@@ look Kyr@@ g@@ ios for the important tie , starting on Friday , describing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long @-@ term fix@@ ture in the team .
&quot; first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ g@@ ios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the lim@@ el@@ ight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Bern@@ ie Sanders cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nation@@ ally , but S@@ en . Bern@@ ie Sanders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 per@@ cent ) , while Sanders comes in second , with 27 per@@ cent ( up from 17 per@@ cent ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary contests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s bac@@ kers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s C@@ BS News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have nar@@ ro@@ wed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only tr@@ ails her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and she and Sanders are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double @-@ dig@@ its among liberals , but Sanders now has a 5 @-@ point edge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nation@@ wide say they would enthusi@@ astically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nomin@@ ee .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 per@@ cent would only back her because she is the nomin@@ ee .
six per@@ cent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support her .
while 48 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusi@@ astically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald Trump ( 35 per@@ cent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open @-@ ended question why they want her to be the nomin@@ ee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 per@@ cent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 per@@ cent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per@@ cent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 per@@ cent ) .
agreement on the issues , and el@@ ect@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nomination , Biden is the top pick .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
if Biden choos@@ es not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead over Sanders wid@@ ens , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fif@@ ty @-@ five per@@ cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 per@@ cent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most el@@ ect@@ able has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nomin@@ ee , Democratic voters pick issues over el@@ ect@@ ability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nomin@@ ee to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
major@@ ities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trust@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thir@@ ty per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about Sanders ( 15 per@@ cent ) , but 27 per@@ cent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ide@@ olog@@ ically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and serv@@ er while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it h@@ asn &apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 per@@ cent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly Republ@@ ic@@ ans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trust@@ worthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 per@@ cent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
six@@ ty @-@ two per@@ cent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and trust@@ worthy .
at the same time , 55 per@@ cent of registered voters nation@@ wide don &apos;t see Trump as honest and trust@@ worthy either .
both Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush do the best on honesty .
more see Sanders as honest than not , but like Carson , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
five frat@@ ern@@ ity members charged in death of Bar@@ uc@@ h College f@@ res@@ h@@ man
nearly two years after a college student died during a frat@@ ern@@ ity haz@@ ing ritual in Pen@@ n@@ syl@@ vania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ uc@@ h College P@@ i Delta PSI frat@@ ern@@ ity brut@@ ally ass@@ a@@ ul@@ ted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initi@@ ation r@@ ite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blind@@ fol@@ ded , sadd@@ led with a 30 @-@ po@@ und backpack full of sand , and repeatedly tack@@ led while he tried to walk to@@ ward a target across a frozen field .
Mr . Den@@ g eventually complained that his head hurt then fell un@@ con@@ sc@@ ious .
P@@ i Delta PSI frat@@ ern@@ ity members did not call 911 after Den@@ g passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Den@@ g &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the frat@@ ern@@ ity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide par@@ aph@@ ern@@ alia and basically put the frat@@ ern@@ ity &apos;s well @-@ being over that of Michael Den@@ g &apos;s , &quot; Chief W@@ ag@@ ner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an autop@@ sy report , Den@@ g was subjected to repeated bl@@ unt force trauma to his head , tor@@ so , and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families have been devastated as a result of frat@@ ern@@ ity haz@@ ing , with at least one student dying every year from haz@@ ing since 1970 , &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an attorney representing Den@@ g &apos;s family , said in a statement .
Frat@@ ern@@ ities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third @-@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thir@@ ty @-@ two other frat@@ ern@@ ity members , including Mr . Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault haz@@ ing and criminal conspiracy .
&quot; we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organiz@@ ation that sanctioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ uc@@ h College banned the frat@@ ern@@ ity and the national frat@@ ern@@ ity revo@@ ked its aff@@ iliation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
a rate hi@@ ke will come and the bull market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond yiel@@ ds will clim@@ b and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
this we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hi@@ ke and as long as 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the U.@@ S. central bank have stressed so vig@@ or@@ ously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the tr@@ aj@@ ect@@ ory of how long it will take to norm@@ aliz@@ e .
there are , indeed , multiple vari@@ ables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @-@ hi@@ ke fus@@ s may have been over@@ done .
&quot; the first hi@@ ke from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Julian Jess@@ op , chief global economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.@@ S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hi@@ ke hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; it does seem there is a trend for equity returns to st@@ all 12 @-@ 24 months after the first hi@@ ke , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 per@@ cent - heading into the rate hi@@ ke , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 per@@ cent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 per@@ cent , according to a recent analysis Bob Dol@@ l , chief equity strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Management , posted on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks ten@@ ds to get more pronounced later in the rate @-@ hi@@ king cycle and returns begin to dimin@@ ish .
reces@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hast@@ en a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hi@@ ke .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 per@@ cent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 per@@ cent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter trac@@ king at just 1.5 per@@ cent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic back@@ drop could be risky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
market participants have been br@@ ac@@ ing for a Fed hi@@ ke all year , with all eyes turned to@@ ward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and economists believe the FO@@ MC could approve a hi@@ ke at this meeting , fut@@ ures trading indicates just a 25 per@@ cent probability .
&quot; in our study since 1950 , all hi@@ king cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP ec@@ lip@@ sing pre@@ recession pea@@ ks very quickly post the recovery comm@@ encing , &quot; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uni@@ qu@@ ely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hi@@ ke , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equ@@ ities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yiel@@ ds change direction immediately as the first hi@@ ke / cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hi@@ king cycle bond yiel@@ ds fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b strateg@@ ists believe the hi@@ ke in rates will cause yiel@@ ds between l@@ on@@ ger@@ - and shorter @-@ dated bonds to move closer together , fl@@ atten@@ ing the cur@@ ve .
high @-@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cautious about stret@@ ching for yield , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analyst at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tigh@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is flat@@ ter , credit spre@@ ads have wid@@ ened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
broad@@ ly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.@@ S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinationals with l@@ ots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Clas@@ sic FM says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham criticised station for &apos; dum@@ bing down@@ &apos;
argues it &apos;s becoming increasingly ind@@ ist@@ ingu@@ ishable from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
colleague Dam@@ ien Collins MP attacked The Voice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; Clas@@ sic FM , a leading MP has claimed , pil@@ ing fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not .
conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; dum@@ bing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly ind@@ ist@@ ingu@@ ishable from its commercial rival .
&quot; radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ bing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Clas@@ sic FM , &quot; he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just mim@@ ic@@ king what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; and also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 control@@ ler Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the to@@ es of commercial rivals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinc@@ tive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the B@@ BC@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Bo@@ y George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in @-@ house stable &quot; next time it launches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ord@@ ering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending licence fee pay@@ ers &apos; money on other entertainment form@@ ats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bol@@ st@@ ered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe November &apos;s Black Friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been bo@@ om@@ ing and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are lev@@ eling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are lev@@ eling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , &apos; Andy Mul@@ ca@@ h@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guardian .
he explained that online sales were bol@@ st@@ ered three years ago when shop@@ pers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contex@@ ts , such as on the sof@@ a .
but now that is plat@@ ea@@ u@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slow@@ ing sales .
experts believe shop@@ pers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of shop@@ pers f@@ locked to their computers to sn@@ ap up deals cr@@ ashing a number of retailers websites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw shop@@ pers fight over barg@@ ains , could be holding shop@@ pers off from making purchases
research published by the British Ret@@ ail Cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca cr@@ ane crash as B@@ in Laden family sanctioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funer@@ als take place in Mecca
come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ lad@@ in Group
the Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 94 people were also injured after the cr@@ ane crashed down
carried A@@ lo@@ ft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a cr@@ ane collapsed at Mecca &apos;s Grand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ is@@ se@@ m cemetery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction cr@@ ane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto wor@@ shi@@ pers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the B@@ in Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the wor@@ shi@@ pers killed when a cr@@ ane crashed collapsed at Mecca &apos;s Grand Central Mos@@ que were carried through the streets
among the dead was father @-@ of @-@ four Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram , from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pilgrimage when the cr@@ ane crashed down .
Mr Ak@@ ram had been in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual h@@ aj@@ j pilgrimage .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the h@@ aj@@ j to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
today , King Salman said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group should not have left the cr@@ ane &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state @-@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the cr@@ ane to top@@ ple into a cour@@ ty@@ ard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the h@@ aj@@ j pilgrimage later this month .
Bin@@ lad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the cr@@ ane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decree also blamed the group for not using up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials .
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mecca &apos;s Grand Mos@@ que , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group .
the Bin@@ lad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
al Qaida &apos;s late leader Osama bin Laden was a reneg@@ ade son dis@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the king@@ dom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every able @-@ bo@@ died Muslim .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
advantages and dis@@ advantages of the conversion of loans in Swiss franc@@ s
on the Banking market two offers have already appeared for the conversion in lei of loans in Swiss franc@@ s , the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and decrease of instal@@ ments .
dis@@ advantages can come in a few years , when the variable interest may lead to the increase of instal@@ ments .
Banca Transilvania has just completed the conversion process of Swiss franc@@ s loans granted by Volksbank and Banc@@ post announced the conversion offer for its clients .
according to the data gathered by the analysts of the financial portal Fin@@ Z@@ oom , Banc@@ post offers a three @-@ year fixed interest rate for lei of 1.5 % , the lowest on the market .
on the other hand , the conversion offer of Banca Transilvania was accepted by 83 % of clients with loans in franc@@ s due to two successive reductions : the balance with the amount of risk and management fees paid by the client was reduced , and then a further reduction of 22.@@ 5 % was applied to the balance in lei .
both offers reduce the instal@@ ments of own clients compared with the monthly payments paid in lei equivalent before conversion .
thus , Banca Transilvania reduces the instal@@ ment by 4@@ 2.5 % and Banc@@ post , by 33 % in the first three years and , theoret@@ ically , by 18 % in coming years .
benefits
the main advantage of the conversion in lei of CH@@ F loans is that it elimin@@ ates currency risk , the client being protected from future increases of the franc and the loan repayment will be made in the currency in which it receives its salary .
another maj@@ our advantage of both offers of conversion is that a re@@ valu@@ ation of property is not performed and additional guarantees and another proof of income are not required .
basically , a new financial and legal analysis of the loan is not performed and additional costs in case of a re@@ financing will not be charged .
in addition , both banks offer a dis@@ counted monthly instal@@ ment , compared to how much clients paid before conversion , in lei equivalent .
risks
the problem is that the instal@@ ment in the first years is formed mostly of interest and the client reimburs@@ es very little from the principal .
Banc@@ post &apos;s offer with a very low interest in the first three years seems advantageous to the client .
it is not known , however , how this interest will evolve after three years .
the margin offered to the clients may exceed 3.@@ 25 % , so the reduction of cost is lower .
a possible risk for all loans in lei with a variable interest is the fact that RO@@ BOR index may increase significantly in the coming years ( more than Lib@@ or index - CH@@ F ) .
for example the current three months RO@@ BOR is 1.@@ 44 % , but in 2013 it had reached 6 % , in 2009 to over 15 % , and within a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40 % !
in addition , it is possible to have other costs , not mentioned in the initial offer .
decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
the world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 per@@ cent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of norm@@ aliz@@ ation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ b@@ ide , senior fellow at the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics .
the US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding tril@@ lions of dollars to the balance she@@ et and generating little inflation .
however the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hi@@ ke but indications are they also believe the od@@ ds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20.00 c@@ et on Thursday .
stars who lost their mo@@ jo
the actor ( left ) , pic@@ tured with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , has had a stres@@ s@@ ful few years .
in 2001 , he bat@@ tled le@@ uk@@ emia , and in 2009 , he lost long @-@ time partner , Far@@ ra@@ h F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , to cancer .
the actor has also reportedly strugg@@ led with drugs , and in 2008 , he was bust@@ ed for drug possession .
all that stuf@@ f sure does take a toll .
Manchester United &apos;s Luke Sha@@ w out for months with double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champions League defeat at PSV E@@ ind@@ h@@ oven .
while this left the full @-@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Gaal remains hop@@ eful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mo@@ ren@@ o in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had bur@@ st into the PSV area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Gaal said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fant@@ astically and then this happens .
when it was in the dres@@ sing room he had an oxygen mask on .
he was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double frac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mo@@ ren@@ o appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot @-@ k@@ ick .
Nicol@@ a Riz@@ z@@ oli , the referee , did not penal@@ ise the Mexican .
van Gaal suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two legs .
a t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how g@@ ut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffer Luke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at PSV
the England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phil@@ li@@ p Coc@@ u , the PSV coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Mo@@ ren@@ o suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal &apos;s Hol@@ land at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mo@@ ren@@ o &#93; tou@@ ched it , but I co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t see the tackle on Luke .
speaking to S@@ B@@ S6 , Mo@@ ren@@ o said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
PSV &apos;s Andr@@ é@@ s Guar@@ d@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris S@@ m@@ alling .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England omis@@ sion but it &apos;s still tough
taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough as@@ sign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 T@@ est series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Al@@ ast@@ air Cook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that bat@@ ting line@@ up and the collective min@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a y@@ ou@@ thful pos@@ itiv@@ ity .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and A@@ dil Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at T@@ est level , represents an attacking option .
related : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England T@@ est squ@@ ad and replaced by Alex H@@ ales
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yor@@ k@@ shire .
his seven T@@ ests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cr@@ ick@@ eters are judged on output .
there were no question marks over Joe R@@ oo@@ t , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best select@@ ors .
a couple of half @-@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hopefully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire another opportunity will come along .
the England head coach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a T@@ est bat@@ sman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven cap@@ s - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a bat@@ sman I rate highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cr@@ ick@@ eter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ shire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a T@@ rent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be affor@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @-@ up of the side in the U@@ AE .
the idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside Cook , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four qu@@ icks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a stro@@ k@@ em@@ ak@@ er cannot bat there and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown he is one hell of a cr@@ ick@@ eter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ers@@ hire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @-@ m@@ ate Justin L@@ anger played his first 38 T@@ ests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ el@@ ed off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar ans@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there are not a h@@ eap of sp@@ in@@ ners putting their hands up and select@@ ors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d additions to their coaching staff .
the appointment of Ma@@ hel@@ a J@@ ay@@ a@@ war@@ d@@ ene , the Sri Lanka bat@@ sman , as a consultant for the T@@ est matches could be a master@@ stroke .
he is one of the game &apos;s lov@@ eli@@ est blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes in for the white @-@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ru@@ thless stre@@ ak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cr@@ ick@@ et , be it playing or coaching , and like Ma@@ hel@@ a has n@@ ous that can be tap@@ ped .
sometimes new voices in the dres@@ sing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can f@@ res@@ hen up a side .
col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham team @-@ m@@ ate Ben Sto@@ kes is rest@@ ed for the one @-@ d@@ ayers , R@@ oo@@ t was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the coaches and select@@ ors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken ligh@@ tly .
Bre@@ xit camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ drum@@ s by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s half @-@ ba@@ ked renegoti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up r@@ ough over Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages too .
a European diplomat ch@@ um explained the other day that , sunk in ass@@ or@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self @-@ absorbed agenda of div@@ is@@ ive concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in Br@@ igh@@ ton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they ero@@ ded social protection .
we could even call it D@@ ave and George &apos;s SE@@ L@@ FI@@ E agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to sum@@ mits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European Pal , who wants an ou@@ tw@@ ard @-@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s cauti@@ ously level @-@ headed chancellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ayers Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is facing re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is a f@@ ading force too .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the SE@@ L@@ FI@@ E Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separatist tend@@ encies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , SN@@ P @-@ style , during the UK &apos;s 2017 referendum campaign to hast@@ en the Bre@@ xit process , my Pal suggests .
&quot; the renegoti@@ ation was a fix &quot; and &quot; Britain got nothing of value out of the renegoti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ dator@@ y F@@ le@@ et Street can be and how EU @-@ sc@@ eptic the olig@@ ar@@ ch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may d@@ im@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the ar@@ ch Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an &quot; EU straight bananas &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 9@@ 0s .
for all his fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness Ed Mil@@ ib@@ and knew who his enemies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ sh@@ y ras@@ cal@@ s , phone @-@ hac@@ king foreigners and pseudo non @-@ Dom@@ s who own most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a Rand@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the bananas to distr@@ act it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact Mil@@ ib@@ and was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cameron &apos;s referendum whe@@ eze , since Blair had conce@@ ded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @-@ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly pat on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @-@ adopting Neil K@@ in@@ n@@ ock &apos;s boycott Mur@@ doc@@ h strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sof@@ a he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kind@@ ly call evolving .
he says he &apos;@@ d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside UKIP &apos;s wo@@ ad @-@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of T@@ ory little Engl@@ and@@ er@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ nite &quot; Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy Sc@@ out in him strugg@@ led not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ ras@@ ive John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old d@@ ad strugg@@ led on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom @-@ up , t@@ ouch@@ y @-@ Fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even tou@@ ched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ st@@ rom that is social media , a h@@ otb@@ ed of par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and betr@@ ayal .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell has said .
Simon Jen@@ kins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equivoc@@ ation about EU membership - consistent with their Ben@@ nite siege economy , anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tw@@ ing dis@@ sid@@ ents for whom the n@@ arc@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doctr@@ inal squ@@ ab@@ bles .
as with his equivoc@@ ation over Nat@@ o - Tom Watson is ad@@ amant that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be point@@ less ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its &quot; fe@@ e@@ ble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts criticise Public Health England e @-@ cigarettes review
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking ar@@ ose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ H@@ E ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ H@@ E published the &quot; landmark &quot; report last month , describing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but several researchers have questioned the ro@@ bust@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the Lanc@@ et medical journ@@ al last month attacked the &quot; extraordin@@ arily fl@@ im@@ sy foundation &quot; on which P@@ H@@ E based its main conclusion .
writing in the B@@ M@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tr@@ op@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public would expect P@@ H@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and model@@ ling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ C@@ DA ) model to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise their opinions on the h@@ arms associated with different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study .

one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the rationale for sel@@ ecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @-@ cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at P@@ H@@ E .
the research paper produced by the group &quot; tel@@ l@@ ingly conce@@ des &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the h@@ arms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ H@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said P@@ H@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and wel@@ l@@ being at P@@ H@@ E , said the claims in the B@@ M@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
one in two lifel@@ ong smokers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @-@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ H@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking @-@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ H@@ S £ 2@@ b@@ n a year .
by sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @-@ cigarettes are not risk @-@ free , they carry only a fr@@ action of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ mit .

&quot; they &apos;ve done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Dav@@ ies at Amnesty .
what we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our do@@ or@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student halls
it &apos;s been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an obl@@ iv@@ ious 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in be@@ rets and moral rel@@ ativ@@ ism , but it &apos;s only now I recall the strained smil@@ es of those I annoyed - and the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
moving into halls can range from mil@@ dly nerve @-@ rac@@ king to totally terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly neither love nor hate Marm@@ ite because seriously gu@@ ys it &apos;s just ye@@ ast extract Ha@@ Ha@@ H@@ a I &apos;ll be in my room . &quot;
take a breath .
and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to Sc@@ out out the people you like versus those you wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t talk to even if your ey@@ el@@ ash@@ es were on fire and they were dis@@ pen@@ sing extingu@@ ish@@ ers .
give people space .
people &apos;s rooms often mor@@ ph into drinks recep@@ tions , movie @-@ night venues and communal hang@@ out spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dressed and adjust their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t even think about starting university in a relationship
Intr@@ over@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a re@@ treat , yet many halls form an inter @-@ room @-@ str@@ ol@@ ling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and conduc@@ ive to lifel@@ ong friend@@ ships .
that can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to re@@ charge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve expen@@ ded on inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alising - and maybe text instead of knocking .
speaking of knocking : do it .
one gu@@ y in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn &apos;t locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
since you &apos;re starting uni at the height of B@@ ake @-@ Of@@ f mania , knocking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a pl@@ ate of brow@@ n@@ ies seems margin@@ ally less we@@ ir@@ d , less 1950s &quot; Wel@@ come to the neighbourhood , I ba@@ ked you something , now smile as I ask you personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade tre@@ ats is a great way to make friends .
your hou@@ sem@@ ates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a tasty surprise .
obviously this is subject to you being a decent bak@@ er .
poorly @-@ f@@ used lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pre@@ tend to be as@@ le@@ ep when you knock .
stealing food is a common crime in student halls .
obviously nic@@ king some@@ ones chicken is theft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing ?
double check with the milk owner .
chances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re see@@ thing inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuf@@ f , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my sympath@@ ies - but try to deal with it more mat@@ ure@@ ly than my h@@ all@@ m@@ ate , who ta@@ int@@ ed her milk with washing @-@ up liquid to punish those who stole it .
she &apos;s in jail now .
you shoul@@ dn &apos;t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
this isn &apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the prov@@ erb@@ ial people in glass houses .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbour if they wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3@@ am and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kind@@ ly let them sleep for two hours before bl@@ asting her own music , loc@@ king her door as she left for her three @-@ hour exam .
wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?
convers@@ ely , wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t it be kn@@ uck@@ le @-@ bit@@ ingly aw@@ k@@ ward if you mist@@ ook a h@@ all@@ m@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouse , ho@@ o@@ ked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends ?
of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot h@@ all@@ m@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
in the exh@@ il@@ ar@@ ating moment you realise someone &apos;s left their keys inside their un@@ locked room , the line between pr@@ an@@ king and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good pr@@ ank is funny , but takes moments to reverse .
teach a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security by hiding something - but never tras@@ h someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sham@@ po@@ o .
lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freez@@ er - but don &apos;t Bl@@ u @-@ T@@ ack their pos@@ sessions to the ceiling more than twice .
David Gr@@ im@@ al , the viol@@ inist : in B@@ ach &apos;s era there were no world tours .
Be@@ eth@@ oven , B@@ rah@@ ms , Bar@@ to@@ k , Enescu were working people , artists , and not commercial representatives .
the French viol@@ inist David Gr@@ im@@ al is one of the great artists of our time , known not only as a sol@@ o@@ ist but also as the initiator of an unusual , down@@ right &quot; we@@ ir@@ d &quot; project , as he himself says , Les dis@@ son@@ ances - an orchestra composed of international sol@@ o@@ ists and talented musicians , who play a sym@@ ph@@ onic repertoire without having a conductor , and this makes it a curiosity , to say the least , in the classical music scene .
Les dis@@ son@@ ances participated this year with two shows in the Enescu Festival : a performance on Sunday , in which the sol@@ o@@ ist was David Gr@@ im@@ al , founder of the orchestra , and one on Monday , when the cel@@ list Xavier Phil@@ lips was in the forefront , the works of Enescu being an indispensable and custom@@ ary element of the event .
both performances on the stage of the Ath@@ en@@ a@@ eum , showed the audience a different way of interpre@@ ting classical music .
Les dis@@ son@@ ances appeared on the music scene in 2004 , at that time being the only classical musical en@@ semble with no conductor .
the conductor is the most important musician for the other musicians .
it is true that musicians need an education to become either sol@@ o@@ ists or performers in an orchestra - here we are talking about instrument@@ alists and not compos@@ ers .
they are trained as &quot; speci@@ aliz@@ ed workers . &quot;
they themselves feel they need to have a conductor .
on the other side of the stage , for the public , all the musical fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ism focuses on the conductor .
and so , the business , the music industry , markets itself .
therefore , we are no longer talking about music .
&quot; so if we look at this world , on the one hand we have skilled workers , which is stupid , and on the other hand we have a public that cannot listen , but must look instead , which is again stupid , &quot; says David Gr@@ im@@ al .
the viol@@ inist says that this change in the way he makes music was the result of the &quot; musical deception &quot; in his solo career .
I was like a professional athlete who had to do the same exercise in different orchest@@ ras around the world , to earn money and to bring money into the music industry .
10 years ago , when I was around 30 years old , I found this thing to be very de@@ pressing because it could not find the creativity and human bro@@ therhood in this system .
so , I had no reason to continue on this path .
this is the moment I decided to create Les dis@@ son@@ ances .
this happens in 2004 , and at that time nobody was doing this kind of thing without a conductor : &quot; the music world was very conservative and did not want this kind of projects . &quot;
&quot; how do you imagine you could market a group of musicians which has no ego ? &quot; asks the artist .
David Gr@@ im@@ al admits that Les Dis@@ son@@ aces is &quot; a luxury , &quot; adding that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project to make a living .
in the 10 years of existence of this group , the absence of a conductor did not prove to be an obstacle for the musical act : &quot; cur@@ i@@ ously , the more we play a more complex repertoire , the simpler it seems , because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the work and not just in the role , &quot; says Gr@@ im@@ al , adding that the show on Sunday &quot; had 74 conduc@@ tors on stage . &quot;
in Gr@@ im@@ al &apos;s opinion , the Enescu Festival is &quot; very brave &quot; just because Les dis@@ son@@ ances were among the guests : &quot; a great festival , featuring the greatest orchest@@ ras in the world which perform even 3 times a day , and in the midst of these orchest@@ ras you also invited this strange group . &quot;
in a temple of the orchest@@ ral tradition , as is the Enescu Festival , there is a the place and interest for something different , which breaks barriers .
speaking about the work of Enescu , the viol@@ inist admits he feels the music the famous Romanian composer , so he did not feel the need for a special approach when he introduced some of Enescu &apos;s work in his repertoire .
Gr@@ im@@ al notes that Enescu &apos;s music is very instinc@@ tive , but that happens when you talk about George Enescu and Romanian music , &quot; because there is a George Enescu who composed French music . &quot;
Gr@@ im@@ al str@@ ives to change the way in which the Cl@@ ass@@ ical music education is carried out , considering that &quot; being a musician , as this activity is organiz@@ ed today , has a taste of death &quot; and that &quot; the future of music is the music itself . &quot;
we do not need to do a world tour 5 times a year if it does not serve anything .
in B@@ ach &apos;s era there were no world tours .
Be@@ eth@@ oven , B@@ rah@@ ms , Bar@@ to@@ k , Enescu were working people , artists , and not commercial representatives .
for me , organiz@@ ing concerts , festivals , tours , release albums , they are all are formidable , extraordinary , but as long as they are in the service of music .
if not , we are part of a system where creativity suffers , no longer has freedom .
to illustr@@ ate this phenomenon , David Gr@@ im@@ al gave the example of Romanian products before and after EU accession : &quot; in Romania , before entering the EU , your vegetables and meat were good . &quot;
to join the EU you had to adopt health laws which are not good for vegetables and meat .
agriculture and production end up in the service of the supermarkets , the same way it &apos;s happens in France .
the same thing happens with music , it &apos;s the same logic .
Les dis@@ son@@ ances makes tomatoes which are not particularly good looking , but you cut them they are ver@@ itable tomatoes .
in an ideal world , this music should be once again be in focus , and the institutions and industries which manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold , but needs to be shared , and this may be achieved starting with the educational policy .
&quot; if we were to believe - as do the Kore@@ ans , the Chinese , the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity , we would re@@ introduce its teaching in schools , we would re@@ introduce the concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell music by @-@ products , &quot; said Gr@@ im@@ al .
certainly , there are things in classical music education which remain very communist . this can be found everywhere , is a very militar@@ iz@@ ed phenomenon .
it depends on the discipline if you compare a musician to a soldier , or if we train a musician to play an instrument , who will be a musician , above all .
we are talking about a completely different education . if we want to train a soldier ( this education - red@@ .@@ n. ) , the training must be conducted in a certain way , if we want to train a musician , we are talking about something else .
in your opinion , who is more dangerous , a soldier or a musician ? , &quot; asks the French artist smiling .
Gr@@ im@@ al shows that for artists , to reward a different way of making music comes from overcoming the &quot; soldier &quot; status , overcoming &quot; the limit imposed by on@@ esel@@ f &quot; : &quot; in a certain moment , musicians discover that they are not soldiers , and therefore leave the concert smiling . &quot;
David Gr@@ im@@ al spoke about his musical project and his vision for the music and the artist in the &quot; Festival of Ide@@ as , &quot; a public discussion organiz@@ ed by the Romanian A@@ sp@@ en Institute during the George Enescu International Festival .

besides his career as a solo artist , David Gr@@ im@@ al wanted to explore more personal projects .

cinema City seeks &quot; Small Big Vo@@ ices &quot;
cinema City launches the ultimate challenge for children : dub@@ bing two characters from the block@@ bu@@ ster &quot; S@@ now Queen 3D &quot;
do you have a super @-@ talented and spontaneous child , who likes movies ?
give him / her the chance to become a star .
in September , during the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children , eager to become the next stars and aged between 8 and 16 , Cinema City seeks &quot; Small Big Vo@@ ices , &quot; giving them the extraordinary opportunity to du@@ b two characters from a famous animated film .
if classic carto@@ ons focused on the sem@@ bl@@ ance of the actor &apos;s voice to the animated character &apos;s features , lately , when a story is created , the persons who will become the voices of the characters are also taken into consideration , and they are usually well @-@ known actors .
however , Cinema City Romania wishes to discover new voices and this is why we are launching this unique campaign .
we want to find the right voice and we challenge parents to register their children in our contest .
they will benefit from a special experience , because the characters are c@@ ute and the lines are funny .
&quot; the children will have fun and will get a real chance to be part of a team of actors , &quot; said Ioana Ionescu , Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania .
in the first stage of the competition , between 11 September to 30 September , Cinema City is organiz@@ ing a pre @-@ selection after which 10 children will be chosen ( five girls and five boys ) who will have the opportunity to aud@@ ition in a recording studio alongside professionals .
all parents have to do is access the platform mic@@ il@@ evoc@@ im@@ ari@@ .@@ cinema @-@ cit@@ y@@ .ro , to register their child in the contest and prepare him / her for the voice aud@@ ition .
then , they have to choose one of four movies available on the platform , download the texts the child is going to read and then the child will be recorded while giving his / her own version of the dub@@ bing .
the contest@@ ants can choose for the aud@@ ition four films about friendship , fairy @-@ tale heroes , magic and hope : &quot; Y@@ el@@ low@@ bird 3D , &quot; &quot; M@@ une : the Guardian of the Moon 3D , &quot; &quot; B@@ lin@@ ky Bill : the Mov@@ ie 3D &quot; and &quot; May@@ a the bee 3D . &quot;
finally , the most talented two children ( a girl and a boy ) will see their dream come true and will du@@ b one character in the block@@ bu@@ ster &quot; The S@@ now Queen - 3D , &quot; which will premiere in Romania in November this year .
Fed@@ E@@ x ear@@ nings mixed , low@@ ers fiscal 2016 outlook
Fed@@ E@@ x reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full @-@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , Fed@@ E@@ x announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 per@@ cent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday &apos;s opening bell .
Fed@@ E@@ x Corp@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 c@@ ents from an earlier predic@@ tion .
analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by F@@ act@@ S@@ et .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 per@@ cent , which will take effect Jan . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground ship@@ ment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects ear@@ nings to grow over the previous year because of cost @-@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was &quot; performing solid@@ ly given weaker @-@ than @-@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the holiday @-@ h@@ iring plans were announced a day after rival U@@ PS said that that it plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended Au@@ g . 31 , Fed@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 per@@ cent from a year earlier .
ear@@ nings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 per@@ cent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has boo@@ sted results at Fed@@ E@@ x G@@ round .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 per@@ cent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher lab@@ or costs .
in pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bell , Fed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 per@@ cent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tuesday down 11 per@@ cent for the year and 17 per@@ cent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve polic@@ y@@ makers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ g@@ any table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
lo@@ om@@ ing over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s orn@@ ate , two @-@ story boar@@ dro@@ om will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that Fed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L . Y@@ ell@@ en and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maxim@@ ize U.@@ S. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great Rec@@ es@@ sion , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a too @-@ close @-@ to @-@ predict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.@@ S. economy is ready to start being we@@ an@@ ed from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing solid@@ ly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already @-@ cautious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the lab@@ or market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M . Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economist at brok@@ er@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market@@ place is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &quot; she said .
there &apos;s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
about half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless polic@@ y@@ makers were to sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,@@ 5@@ 99.@@ 85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that Fed polic@@ y@@ makers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; it would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
if Fed polic@@ y@@ makers did , &quot; they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.@@ S. recovery .
Y@@ ell@@ en had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , lab@@ or market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of pic@@ king up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , Fed polic@@ y@@ makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ t@@ ness of the lab@@ or market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on macro@@ economics .
but financial markets around the world started conv@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China devalu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slow@@ ing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has re@@ bo@@ unded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for Fed polic@@ y@@ makers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D . O@@ lin@@ er , a senior research fellow at the UC@@ LA Z@@ iman Center for Real E@@ state and a former Fed official .
now , he predic@@ ts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the imp@@ acts on the U.@@ S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post @-@ dates the developments in China , &quot; O@@ lin@@ er said .
the health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the Fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it shoul@@ dn &apos;t be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere h@@ int by then @-@ Chairman Ben S . Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the Fed might &quot; T@@ aper &quot; its monetary expansion triggered market conv@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision @-@ making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth @-@ management firm En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lac@@ ker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , Va . , noted this month that &quot; the Fed has a history of over@@ reacting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lac@@ ker , a voting member of the polic@@ y@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 @-@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identi@@ fi@@ able implications for U.@@ S. growth , &quot; Lac@@ ker said .
a year later , Fed officials rever@@ sed those cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market m@@ elt@@ down , said Adam S . P@@ osen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rate @-@ setting committee .
the latest turmoil doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hi@@ ke because markets got upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

4 K@@ illed Af@@ ter Police Fire Rub@@ ber bullets at Protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr . D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less @-@ le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the Mad@@ he@@ si ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dil@@ ute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Au@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step to@@ ward a new constitution but a highly cont@@ entious issue in Nepal , which has been centr@@ ally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been under@@ way since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .

for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese diabet@@ ics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments , however .
&quot; the mortality data take a long time to show up , &quot; said Dr . Robin Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations , or bari@@ atr@@ ic surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , bari@@ atr@@ ic sur@@ ger@@ ies have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bid@@ ly ob@@ ese , with a body mass index ( B@@ MI ) of 35 or above .
B@@ MI , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a B@@ MI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ MI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your B@@ MI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ en@@ g General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial compar@@ ing two kinds of bari@@ atr@@ ic surgery - gastr@@ ic bypass and sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mil@@ dly ob@@ ese .
the average B@@ MI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the B@@ MI among those receiving non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 per@@ cent and partially in 28 per@@ cent .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 per@@ cent and partially in only about 2 per@@ cent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , trig@@ ly@@ cer@@ ides , and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L chol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; was generally better in the surgical group , &quot; the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
Hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 per@@ cent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 per@@ cent to about 6 per@@ cent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 per@@ cent .
but this better &quot; gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead researcher Dr . Chi@@ h @-@ chen@@ g H@@ SU and colleagues .
the research team also compared average out@@ comes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger drops in B@@ MI ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.1 ) and in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 per@@ cent vs 2.1 per@@ cent ) and were more likely to have complete diabetes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 per@@ cent vs 16.@@ 7 per@@ cent ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Arizona College of Medicine @-@ Pho@@ eni@@ x .
in the Swedish study , ob@@ ese people who had bari@@ atr@@ ic surgery were about 29 per@@ cent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s reas@@ suring for people with a B@@ MI under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower B@@ MI group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s B@@ MI falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve accumulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into obesity and diabetes , rever@@ sing that is really hard .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Bud@@ d@@ hist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
he also stressed that , however admir@@ able , the West @-@ European countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; it it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; so taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he emphas@@ iz@@ ed .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US &quot; violent response eng@@ en@@ dered a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after 9 / 11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non @-@ violence .
I know his motiv@@ es were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .
four@@ fol@@ d increase in children ing@@ est@@ ing hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er in last 4 years
po@@ ison control cent@@ ers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 @-@ per@@ cent up@@ t@@ ick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 sw@@ allowing highly @-@ alcoholic hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er , according to the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr . G@@ ay@@ l@@ ord Lopez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er ing@@ est@@ ion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ ison control cent@@ ers went up from 3,@@ 2@@ 66 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; k@@ ids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; Lopez told CNN .
he said some k@@ ids are drinking san@@ it@@ iz@@ er intention@@ ally , while some do it to impress their friends or on a social @-@ media dare .
videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking san@@ it@@ iz@@ er for a cheap buz@@ z .
te@@ ens have reportedly mixed san@@ it@@ iz@@ er with alcohol @-@ containing mouth@@ wash for a stif@@ fer drink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive san@@ it@@ iz@@ er sc@@ ents .
&quot; a k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; Lopez said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ ers ) are the ones that are sc@@ ented .
there are str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ry , gr@@ ape , orange @-@ fl@@ avo@@ red hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ ers that are very appealing to k@@ ids .
hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er contains anywhere between 45 and 95 per@@ cent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol poisoning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr . Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison control cent@@ er at University of K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , told Fox 4 in K@@ ans@@ as City .
so you wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ ers out and if k@@ ids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently ing@@ est@@ ed as many as four squ@@ ir@@ ts of str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ry @-@ sc@@ ented hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally dr@@ unk in an adult , according to Dr . Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ win@@ net@@ t Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CNN .
it could have been very le@@ thal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alcoholic products or san@@ it@@ iz@@ ing wi@@ p@@ es short of moving hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er out of a child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol poisoning , some san@@ it@@ iz@@ ers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two On@@ tari@@ o women died after sw@@ allowing hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health officials s@@ urm@@ ised that the product contained me@@ than@@ ol , a deadly agent , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredient .
in January , three fourth @-@ grade students in up@@ state New York pl@@ ot@@ ted to po@@ ison their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting anti@@ bacter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly all@@ erg@@ ic to hand san@@ it@@ iz@@ er and banned it from her room .
police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be &quot; id@@ le ch@@ at@@ ter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the UK &apos;s rate of 5.5 per cent , the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) figures showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three month period , with the number of those in work now standing at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 per cent .
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mun@@ del@@ l , commenting on the latest figures , said : &quot; the government &apos;s long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling .
why I &apos;m A Wit@@ ness A@@ t An Ex@@ ecution In Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
wh@@ o@@ ever is pic@@ ked will watch it dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours .
I like the gu@@ y .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed a not@@ e@@ book and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
one Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my imparti@@ ality .
here &apos;s the lesson .
tell the in@@ m@@ ate &apos;s story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have ph@@ r@@ ased it better , &quot; but still thinks I &apos;m wrong to do what I &apos;m doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the public@@ ity will help the anti @-@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bel@@ l@@ ware , a reporter from the Huffington Post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of po@@ d@@ cast@@ s I &apos;ve made .
I won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an access@@ ory after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
Peter Moody alleg@@ es ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit rac@@ ing
Peter Moody has alleged Rac@@ ing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to quit rac@@ ing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and Rac@@ ing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , alleg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final str@@ aw on Wednesday .
Moody told F@@ air@@ fax Media he had always tried to do what is best for rac@@ ing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lid@@ ari &apos;s positive sw@@ ab to CO@@ B@@ AL@@ T , which he can not explain .
he had bit@@ ten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like s@@ our grapes . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , &quot; Moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I shoul@@ dn &apos;t be a train@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
earlier , Moody had dropped the bomb@@ shell in a rac@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ables to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moody said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe I &apos;m a che@@ at .
if that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their brief@@ s because they &apos;ve been incompetent in trying to catch me .
Robert Ro@@ ul@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of b@@ alls and maybe make people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I am .
maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
but I &apos;ve got to the point now where I don &apos;t care and that sadd@@ ens me .
that really sadd@@ ens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I &apos;ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
the train@@ er &apos;s frustration levels have built with the long @-@ running CO@@ B@@ AL@@ T inquiry involving Lid@@ ari and the late scr@@ at@@ ching had him saying that he could &quot; throw my licence across the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for preparing un@@ beaten champion Black Cav@@ iar , lab@@ elled the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a mud or cl@@ ay po@@ ult@@ ice had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
it &apos;s against the rules of rac@@ ing .
I &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
one of my staff mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly lac@@ ed mud on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the race day treatment using the po@@ ult@@ ice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a joke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &quot; Moody said .
Co@@ br@@ am hit @-@ and @-@ run driver arrested
police have arrested a man over a hit @-@ and @-@ run collision with a cyclist in Co@@ br@@ am at the weekend .
the cyclist was air@@ lifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning .
police said the motor@@ ist dr@@ ove away without stopping to help the injured ri@@ der .
on Monday a 50 @-@ year @-@ old N@@ ath@@ alia man handed himself in to police at Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident , failing to ren@@ der assistance , and other traffic offences .
the cyclist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Co@@ br@@ am man , remains in hospital in a stable condition .
Melbourne Stor@@ m coach Craig Bel@@ lam@@ y hits back at rivals over wrest@@ ling claims
Melbourne Stor@@ m coach Craig Bel@@ lam@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the N@@ RL &apos;s two premi@@ ership favourites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach T@@ rent Rob@@ inson said the referees allowed the Stor@@ m to &quot; wrest@@ le &quot; his side during the Stor@@ m &apos;s upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Br@@ is@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos coach W@@ ayne Ben@@ net@@ t made a thin@@ ly ve@@ iled reference to the Stor@@ m after his side &apos;s qualifying final win over North Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a &quot; show@@ case &quot; of the rugby league and said the two Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and w@@ ere@@ n &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into wrest@@ ling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Stor@@ m beating them .
&quot; that keeps coming up - I didn &apos;t hear T@@ rent Rob@@ inson bring up wrest@@ ling when they beat us 24 @-@ 2 , &quot; Bel@@ lam@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tack@@ les and that has been the turn around for us .
T@@ rent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it &apos;s funny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bel@@ lam@@ y challenged Ben@@ net@@ t &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; remin@@ ding his mentor that Ben@@ net@@ t &apos;s St George @-@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the premi@@ ership in 2010 by playing &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; football .
W@@ ayne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
he made a point of compar@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bel@@ lam@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and W@@ ayne said he didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s Ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like that .
to me it buil@@ ds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably w@@ ere@@ n &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bel@@ lam@@ y also pointed out the Stor@@ m and R@@ oo@@ sters game was a higher scoring contest than the Bron@@ cos and Co@@ w@@ boys game .
the Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t watched it yet but what was the score ? 16 @-@ 12 ?
our game it was 20 @-@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting ?
to me it &apos;s ag@@ end@@ as .
if they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the Stor@@ m have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Que@@ en@@ sl@@ and Co@@ w@@ boys or Cr@@ on@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks in next Saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at A@@ ami Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g used girls phone to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ iles to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile used an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s phone to solicit child abuse images .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she sl@@ ept then log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service where he had a succession of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hog@@ g &apos;s hand .
she looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately aler@@ ting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web searches using terms for finding in@@ decent image of children .
Hog@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ iles &quot; on the internet before &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ding he was a police officer to s@@ care them . &quot;
fiscal deput@@ e E@@ il@@ id@@ h Robertson told Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it was an addiction - that he was add@@ ic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ tend to be a police officer to s@@ care pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ iles .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
Ms Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying .
she saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and the accused was then confron@@ ted .
the girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Play@@ St@@ ation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
Hog@@ g , 23 , of W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pl@@ eaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making in@@ decent images of children on June 14 last year , bre@@ aching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence solic@@ itor Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g not be placed on the sex off@@ enders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Carm@@ ic@@ ha@@ el defer@@ red sentence until October for social work background reports .
Hog@@ g was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the sex off@@ enders register ahead of his sent@@ encing date .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe deliv@@ ers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium .
he was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went viral on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tar@@ n@@ ished by claims by opposition legisl@@ ators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
last month , they booed and hec@@ k@@ led him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) chief wh@@ ip In@@ noc@@ ent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to dis@@ rupt nr Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message is coming from a number which is not reflect@@ ing but it &apos;s titled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief wh@@ ip said the party , led by Morgan Ts@@ v@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost @-@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
H@@ P is spl@@ it@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and pr@@ inter businesses from its faster @-@ growing corporate hard@@ ware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.7@@ b@@ n , beginning in the fourth quarter , H@@ P said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enter@@ prise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , the H@@ P chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enter@@ prise will be smaller and more focused than H@@ P is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enter@@ prise will have more than $ 50@@ b@@ n in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on deliv@@ ering un@@ riv@@ aled integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t and D@@ ave Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to gar@@ age has been dubbed &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
H@@ P has been under@@ going a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by H@@ P , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar por@@ tr@@ ay@@ als in shows is gl@@ aring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young m@@ ales at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in m@@ ales than fem@@ ales .
in a bid to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Liv@@ ing mis@@ er@@ ably ( calm ) announced 2015 as the Year of the M@@ ale , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students displaying depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ ere@@ r had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
equally , for those not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social @-@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often priorit@@ ised over meaning@@ ful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun @-@ lov@@ ing and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extr@@ in@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ in@@ sic values - our inner ye@@ ar@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply imp@@ acts our mental health .
and as a billionaire video @-@ game creator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ross &apos;s P@@ ining for Rach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully expl@@ oring their feelings .
as a Sam@@ ar@@ itan worker explained to me : .... &quot; my listening role to people feeling de@@ pressed and su@@ ic@@ idal has really highlighted how even the smallest inter@@ actions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ad@@ age of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
as much as my objective , out@@ sider status over the phone helps people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central &apos;s Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central per@@ k .
or , better still , if in St@@ arb@@ uc@@ ks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hel@@ lo .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broadcasting on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria scores to help PSG SW@@ AT aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after scoring against Malmo .
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday .
here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princ@@ es on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ h@@ tar Donet@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the kn@@ ock@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a v@@ int@@ age display by Laurent Blan@@ c &apos;s side with Zlatan Ibrahim@@ ovic w@@ ast@@ eful in front of goal and later being substit@@ uted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustr@@ ious career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League , so to win 2 @-@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &quot; said Blan@@ c .
it aug@@ urs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
Ibrahim@@ ovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2 @-@ 2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Lig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentina w@@ inger was lab@@ elled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco V@@ err@@ atti &apos;s pass in behind the Malmo defence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected PSG to rom@@ p to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Malmo , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at k@@ ick @-@ off and , with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stuf@@ fy opponents .
but , save for a Nikola Djur@@ d@@ jic shot that sli@@ d just wide of Kevin T@@ rap@@ p &apos;s far post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PSG let themselves down at times with some w@@ ast@@ eful passing and poor finishing , not least from Ibrahim@@ ovic , who failed to conver@@ t no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more adep@@ t when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an Ibrahim@@ ovic pass that Di Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was tip@@ ped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the ur@@ ugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahim@@ ovic had f@@ lic@@ ked on a left @-@ wing cross from Max@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by Wil@@ and from point @-@ blank range to deny David L@@ ui@@ z kept the final score down before substitute E@@ z@@ equ@@ iel Lav@@ ez@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Malmo coach Age H@@ are@@ ide later admitted PSG were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
the qualifiers are not enough .
hats off to Paris .
it was a magn@@ ificent match from them .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , hit by collapsing commod@@ ities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt @-@ sl@@ ashing plan .
London @-@ listed Gl@@ enc@@ ore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 per@@ cent of its market value this year , is gr@@ appl@@ ing with tum@@ bling commod@@ ity prices as China &apos;s economic slowdown weigh@@ s on demand and spar@@ ks h@@ avo@@ c across markets .
the rights issue sent Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s share price so@@ aring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
shares jumped 2.@@ 77 per@@ cent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 pen@@ ce on the F@@ T@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 per@@ cent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had last week revealed the $ 2.5 @-@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to sl@@ ash its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 125 pen@@ ce per share , which marked a 2.4 @-@ per@@ cent discount to the closing price on Tuesday .
it off@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per@@ cent of the group .
concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have sl@@ ashed iron ore prices by r@@ oughly a half , as coal , copper and other commod@@ ities have fallen by 20 to 40 per@@ cent .
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with ste@@ ering reform on Tuesday .
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve opening @-@ up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th Me@@ eting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for deepening O@@ ver@@ all Re@@ form .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , Xi said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of border @-@ control policies , encouraging state @-@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absorb private capital and over@@ haul@@ ing the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off @-@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial program@@ s .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources , ensuring a law @-@ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy to@@ ward foreign investment , and will protect the law@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by optim@@ iz@@ ing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ iang , and senior leaders Liu Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Zh@@ ang Ga@@ oli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
education unions , dissatisfied with the Government &apos;s proposal to raise salaries by 10 %
negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and education union leaders have not reached any result , the Government proposing a salary increase of 10 % from 1 December , with payment from 1 January 2016 and the unions wanted an increase of 15 % in November and 20 % in December .
the discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening , the Prime Minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education , Sorin C@@ IM@@ PE@@ ANU , the Minister of Finance , Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour , Rovana Plumb .
we were not satisfied by the Government &apos;s proposal made today . otherwise we would not have reached the situation to convene our feder@@ ations .
the 10 % promised to us today is less than what we expected .

more than 100 flight atten@@ d@@ ants , fired because they were too fat
air India Air@@ line is firing about 130 ste@@ wards and ste@@ war@@ des@@ ses that are over@@ weight , the company said at the end of last week .
the state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations , but critics say the measure is &quot; ridiculous &quot; and &quot; sh@@ ock@@ ingly sex@@ ist , &quot; according to The Washington Post .
the mass dismissal is the latest in a ten @-@ year battle between the company and over@@ weight flight atten@@ d@@ ants .
the weight limit for them dates from the &apos; 8@@ 0s , when Air India began using ideal weight and height graphics .
in 2006 , Air India fired nine ste@@ war@@ des@@ ses considered &quot; exceptionally over@@ weight , &quot; as this &quot; can have an effect on refl@@ ex@@ es and impe@@ de the ag@@ ility necessary to perform emergency measures . &quot;
the ste@@ war@@ des@@ ses have sued the company , won and were re@@ hired , but the company fired them again in 2009 .
&quot; all efforts to cause them to lose weight have failed , &quot; explained then a company spokesman .

a football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali in terms of promoting young players .
after the champion &apos;s financ@@ er decided to close the Football Academy in which he has invested a considerable amount , defender Paul Papp opened a Football School .
&quot; Paul Papp &quot; Academy will operate in the city of Dej , and the city &apos;s children are expected for a first selection .
I am extremely happy to have reached this stage , to k@@ ick off the Football Academy which bears my name .
for me , it is extremely important to find talented children , who can play football without worrying about the future during training .
they must have only one thought : to play football as good as possible .
the technical details do not have to be in their care .
they must capitalise their talent .
this is what &quot; Paul Papp &quot; Football Academy aims to do .
&quot; I expect mayor Cost@@ an Morar to be at the children &apos;s first selection , to prove to them that he supports them , &quot; said footballer Papp for de@@ je@@ anul@@ .ro .

all party members have decided to remain in power .
on Tuesday , the interim president of PSD ( Social Democratic Party ) Liviu Dragnea said that all party members decided to remain in power , and if the prime minister agrees , this decision will be form@@ aliz@@ ed during the PSD Congress .
I understand that Mr Ponta expect this decision from the PSD congress , all members want to remain in power , the whole party .
if he wants this decision to be form@@ aliz@@ ed by a decision of the Congress , we will do it .
there is no doubt about it .
&quot; there are no developments , voices , opinions within the party to give the uncertainty of wanting to be part of the government or give the impression that anyone in the party does not want PSD to remain in power , in the current government , with the current prime minister , &quot; said Dragnea at the end of the PSD National Standing Bureau meeting .
PSD announced it will organise a Congress - and that this issue will be decided then
on Tuesday , Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that bes@@ ide el@@ ecting its leadership , during the PSD Congress the members of the party should decide if the party will be part of the current government or join the opposition .

on the other hand , Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position during the next Congress or not .
on Monday , after the Executive Committee , I will weigh the decision if the congress date is set .
&quot; I will announce whether I will run for the party leadership or not &quot; said Dragnea at the end of Tuesday &apos;s meeting of the PSD National Standing Bureau .
asked if his hes@@ it@@ ancy regarding the announcement of his candidacy has anything to do with his criminal file , Dragnea said he did not have this problem .
I do not have the problem you are referring to , but it seems right and fair to all my colleagues in the party to announce my candidacy at the time of the establishment of the congress date .
&quot; it &apos;s my only motivation , &quot; said Dragnea .
most social democratic branches proposed the date of October 11 for the extraordinary congress , and the exact date will be decided on Monday by the Executive Committee of the party .

what happens with coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career , as she is being forced to choose whether to continue or not to collaborate with coach Darren Cahill .
the two have worked together this year in the A@@ did@@ as Player Development Programme , the Australian coach staying with the Romanian tennis player only during maj@@ our tournaments .
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill , who seems to be the only coach who managed to assert himself in front of the wh@@ im@@ s@@ ical tennis player .
however , the A@@ did@@ as program will end at the end of this year and Halep must decide whether she provides Cahill with a consistent contract or if she qu@@ its working with him .
we do not know yet exactly what will happen .
we will talk and see .
&quot; after Singapore I will be able to provide an answer &quot; confessed Simona at a press conference .
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today and he is asking for a contract of a million dollars a year .
in addition , the Australian is also a sports comment@@ ator , a job he wo@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t want to quit now .
the last competition during which Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions Tournament from Singapore .
it was not normal , I was not respected
Victor Piturca has revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team in the fall of last year .
the former coach said she did not get along with FRF president , Razvan Burleanu who replaced Mircea Sandu , and so he decided to leave the national team .
finally , the head of the Federation was asked to substantial increase his salary to make him stay , but he refused .
right now I &apos;m not sorry that I left the national team .
I was sorry then , because I was leaving my work behind .
I thought that what I was doing at the time was good for me and I think it was indeed good for me .
what happened to me when I was coach was not normal , I was not respected , people did not respect my work .
I worked well with those who used to be in the Federation before , but when Burleanu came to the Federation he had pre@@ conceived ideas about me although he did not know me . he used to make his opinion about me from the news .
I was not replaced because it was very difficult at that time , considering the results I had , plus the financial situation was taken into account .
I continued working , everything went very well and perhaps he changed his opinions .
but I wanted to leave .
if he really wanted me to stay , I proposed an extension of the contract .
my salary was about 400 something thousand Eur@@ os per year and I was going to receive around 600 thousand Eur@@ os .
I did not talk to Burleanu , but with his right hand .
&quot; he agreed , but only if the team managed to finish in the first place of the group , &quot; said Victor Piturca for Dolce Sport .
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall , although the team perform well in the Euro 2016 qualifiers .
the coach has accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia , immediately joining team Al Ittihad .
arm@@ our @-@ cl@@ ad vehicles and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police disp@@ at@@ ched military Hum@@ ve@@ e vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia after the violent clashes of Wednesday , when water cannons and te@@ arg@@ as were used against immigrants who wanted to come in from Serbia , despite the fact that Hungary raised a barbed wire fence .
at least 20 policemen and two children were injured during the clashes , writes Russia Today .
so far 20 policemen were injured and the ambulance service took over two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence .
&quot; we will rebuild the fence , we will strengthen it and we will protect the security of Hungary by any means , &quot; said Hungarian Prime Minister &apos;s security adviser , Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ ond@@ i .
police tried to control the mass of people throwing plastic bottles , rocks and pieces of pavement with water cannons and te@@ arg@@ as .
the authorities reported that several dozens of immigrants broke the fence between the cities of R@@ ö@@ sz@@ ke and H@@ org@@ os and have managed to enter into the country .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to urged Serbia to take action against the &quot; very aggressive &quot; immigrants at their common border .
there are reports that Serbs have supplemented their police forces at the border .
following the incident on Wednesday , Budapest suspended border crossing at R@@ ö@@ sz@@ ke @-@ H@@ org@@ os for 30 days .

the rare illness of a man
American Nick H@@ ess was suspected by his family to be an alcoholic and his wife even filmed him when he was intox@@ icated , barely holding himself standing and speaking words which were difficult to understand .
although the 35 year old man said he had not been drinking , it was visible that he was intox@@ icated .
when she first accused me of being dr@@ unk without me drinking I thought she was crazy .
&quot; but my friends and family thought &quot; that maybe he drinks alone , that he is a secret alcoholic , &apos; &quot; he says , according to the Mirror .
when he saw his wife &apos;s films with himself the man from Columb@@ us , Ohio did not recogn@@ ize himself : &quot; I looked into my eyes and I was not there . &quot;
&quot; it was aw@@ ful , I do not remember anything . &quot;
in addition , his wife , who , although doub@@ ted him for a while , finally took him to countless doctors , remembers that even Nick &apos;s breath sm@@ elled of alcohol .
the thing that most got Nick thinking was when , after a minor accident , when he had been hit by another car , he was found to have a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit , although the night before he had just one beer .
after years and countless investigations , it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease , &quot; Auto @-@ bre@@ w@@ ery syndrome . &quot;
basically , his body makes all the consumed car@@ bs to fer@@ ment , turning them into alcohol .
the one who suspected that this might be Nick &apos;s illness was his wife .
the disease has no cure yet , but since he gave up car@@ bs , Nick has not experienced such episodes .
a man destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
a South Korean man destroyed his own car , a Mercedes S@@ 63 , in protest of the services offered by his deal@@ er .
the man &quot; attacked &quot; the car with a golf club , causing enough damage that the car had to be sc@@ rap@@ ped , says BT .

the government approved on Wednesday the &quot; National Strategy on Migration for 2015 @-@ 2018 &quot; and the &quot; Action Plan for the current year , &quot; documents regarded as &quot; another step taken by Romania within its efforts to modernise the immigration management process on national territory , &quot; according to a press release .
the source shows that the strategy aims at the efficient management of the immigration phenomenon , including strategic goals , specific objectives and courses of action which reflect the policies established at European level , adapted to national realities .
given the problems faced by Romania &apos;s neighbouring countries , measures for the unified and coherent management of the situation are taken into consideration due to the possible influx of illegal immigrants in Romania , generated by the crisis situations of political , social , economic or military nature .
&quot; Romanian authorities will contribute to the establishment of a flexible admission system , but at the same time , they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with migration potential or who may affect national security , &quot; adds the mentioned source .
the strategy identi@@ fies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum , including the continuation of the conflict situation in Syria , the re@@ activ@@ ation of the Iraq conflict , maintaining an unstable situation in Romania &apos;s bord@@ ering areas ( Ukraine , Transnistria ) , continuation and intensific@@ ation of the Israeli - Palestinian armed conflict .
on the other hand , the document sets some general strategic objectives regarding immigration , such as : promotion of legal migration , tigh@@ ter controls of legal residence of third @-@ country citizens in Romania and the appropriate application of removal and restrictive measures , improvement of the national asylum system .
the National Strategy includes specific objectives relevant for transpos@@ ing and implementing overall strategic objectives .
these include : facilitating access in Romania of third party citizens that meet the employment needs , favouring access of third countries citizens for higher education institutions in Romania for fields and professions identified as de@@ ficient .
regarding the Action Plan for 2015 , the Government considers that it is &quot; a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon . &quot;
Romania , in a European top on the labour market
Latvia , Romania and Bulgaria registered the largest increase in the total cost of labour among member states of the European Union in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2014 , according to data released Wednesday by the European Office for Statistics ( Eurostat ) .
the index refers to employers &apos; personnel expenses .
thus , during April and June 2015 , the total cost of labour increased by 1.9 % in the EU and 1.6 % in the Euro area .
Romania ranks third in the EU labour cost growth
the largest increases were reported in Latvia ( 7.@@ 9 % ) , Romania ( 7.@@ 7 % ) , Bulgaria ( 6.8 % ) , Estonia ( 5.5 % ) and Lithuania ( 4.3 % ) .
the only EU countries where ho@@ ur@@ ly labour costs decreased in the second quarter of this year were Greece ( minus 2.9 % ) , Cyprus ( minus 1.2 % ) and Italy ( minus 0.4 % ) .
the increase of labour costs in Romania during April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the ho@@ ur@@ ly labour cost in industry and services , with 7.@@ 9 % and respectively 7.@@ 6 % .
in the construction sector , Romania registered an increase of 5.@@ 8 % of the ho@@ ur@@ ly cost of labour .
activity report of the TVR ( Romanian National Television Network ) leadership , rejected by the committees : Stelian Tanase risks to be dismissed
on Wednesday , the Parliament Commit@@ tees on Culture rejected the report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television for 2014 .
17 parliamentarians voted for the rejection of the report , one was against the rejection ( senator Varujan Vosganian ) and one abstained .
the text of the report will be submitted to the joint Standing bure@@ aus .
the decision will be taken next week , probably .
this will be discussed at the next plenary meeting .
&quot; considering the situation , I think the decision will be taken relatively quickly , &quot; said the president of the Senate Committee on Culture , Georg@@ ica Severin .
he added that it was &quot; common sense &quot; that TVR management be present at this meeting , given that no representative of TVR management attended the meetings of the Commit@@ tees on Culture .
it was common sense that the leadership of TVR be present because nobody here has been subjected to personal attacks or something similar .
the invitation was made to the members of the Board of Directors as early as last night , with an approxim@@ ate time because we did not know the exact time ourselves , but today , after the meeting of the joint Standing Commit@@ tees , I have personally sent a fax to the management of TVR , inviting them .
I believe that when you are called , even if you don &apos;t like it , you give course to the invitation because you are a budgetary employee who is paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the joint Standing Commit@@ tees .
&quot; you do it because it &apos;s your work obligation , you &apos;re part of an institution which is sub@@ ordinated to the Parliament , &quot; said Severin after the meeting of the joint Standing Commit@@ tees on Culture of the Parliament .
he added that the financial aspects of the institution on the adverse opinion of the budget committees were discussed during the meeting .
we all saw the evolution of the debts . someone came up with the idea that the debts have been paid within the prescribed period , but the historical ones have not been paid .
&quot; I remind you that it &apos;s not my fault or someone else &apos;s fault in this committees that the agreement with the banks and tax authorities was dropped . these are clear management issues , &quot; said Severin .
he added that after the progress report will be rejected by the plen@@ um , elections will be held for a new Board of Directors , thus the new director of the institution will be appointed .
I do not know who will be proposed for this position .
there will be no mirac@@ les .
it is important to take political decisions for this institution to function .
I &apos;m not going to lie to you and tell you a gen@@ ius will appear and hold the line here and fight .
I hope that those with decision making abilities , namely the Parliament , will use reason when choosing the people who will lead TVR .
these people must know what is happening there , have experience and show fairness and respect towards the institution and the tradition .
I do not know who it will be . if you ask me what qualities I think the candidate must pos@@ s@@ ess - I would say common sense in his attitude towards employees because a pile of petitions will come from employees , claims , lay@@ offs .
&quot; when you receive so many not@@ ifications - 50 , 60 , 70 , something is rot@@ ten and the financial situation is a disaster , &quot; concluded the chairman of Senat &apos;s Comit@@ ee on Culture .
although he did not attend the Parliament meeting , the president and CEO of TVR , Stelian Tanase , sent a letter to President of the Chamber of Deputies , Valeriu Zgonea , request@@ ing the Parliament to consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and assurance of the economic and political independence of the public television . TV tax index@@ ing is among these measures .
in his letter , Stelian Tanase solic@@ its , in addition to TV tax index@@ ation , the amending and supplement@@ ing of G@@ D 9@@ 78 / 2003 on public television service fee , meaning the update of the technological provisions , and the regulation of the control procedure of TV tax payment and the establishment of infring@@ ements and penalty implementation .
he also solic@@ its the issuing of a provision to stip@@ ulate that all electricity suppliers are oblig@@ ated to become mand@@ atories of RT@@ C ( Romanian television company ) for the collection of TV taxes , by involving the ANRE ( National Regulatory Authority for Energy ) for the regulation of this activity .
in his opinion , it is necessary to set the upper limit of commission@@ able revenues to 5 % .
Stelian Tanase ask for the reduction of VAT rates for the specific activities of the public television network and Na@@ o ( National Audit Office ) contribution from 15 % to 3 % . he also asks for the amendment of law 41 / 1994 , which stipulates the possibility to receive budget allocation / funding for the acquisition of licenses for maj@@ our cultural and spor@@ ting events - football World Cup , Cer@@ bul de AU@@ R ( the Golden Sta@@ g ) , Eurovision .
he says the RT@@ C will go into default in the next few months given that the labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce court decisions , even if these are not definitive , and the remuneration shall be honoured with priority over any other obligation .
the administration of TVR has made constant efforts to reduce personnel and TV production expenses .
&quot; thus travel and other activity costs were reduced , a number of commercial contracts were renegoti@@ ated , and at the end of July TVR News was closed , &quot; reads the letter of the President of TVR .
Tanase estimated that disastrous financial situation cannot be remedi@@ ed only through internal efforts .
&quot; without the support of state institutions - government , parliament , president - the Romanian Television will be sooner or later unable to even meet its public mission , &quot; reads the letter .
the leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture .
Vasile Blaga &apos;s son in law , indicted
Vasile Blaga &apos;s son in law , Ionut Andrei Ru@@ deanu , was indicted Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Court of Appe@@ al Bucharest .
he is accused of tax evasion in a case with a prejudice of 600,000 euros , being placed under judicial control .
Andrei Ru@@ deanu was taken in custody on May 22 .
he founded a security company Ax@@ is Corporate Security SRL , along with his mother in April 2009 , a year after mar@@ rying the daughter of Vasile Blaga , Ag@@ a@@ the .
the investigation revealed that , in order to evade the payment of taxes to the state budget , representatives of a company specialising in providing security services have created a criminal circuit , formed of several companies , through which fictitious transactions were performed .
&quot; in fact , the company &apos;s accounts registered fictitious acquis@@ itions of services , which in reality were not provided , the state budget being thus so prejud@@ iced with about 600,000 euros &quot; explained the Romanian Police in a press release .
She@@ ik@@ h@@ s have established the fate of Sanmartean
al @-@ Ittihad club &apos;s she@@ ik@@ h@@ s have determined the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean .
although Arab media announced that the separation between Sanmartean and Ittihad is imminent , coach Lad@@ isl@@ au Boloni &apos;s agent , Ar@@ cad@@ ia Zap@@ or@@ oj@@ anu , says this will no longer happen .
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean .
Lucian is starting every game and does it well .
the She@@ ik@@ h@@ s also realised that he is the best and that it would be wrong to give him up .
they could have brought a much better player , but nothing came out .
&quot; there were several discussions , for example with M@@ bar@@ k B@@ ous@@ sou@@ fa , but nothing was established , &quot; said Zap@@ or@@ oj@@ anu for DI@@ G@@ I Sport .
Lucian Sanmartean came to Al @-@ Ittihad earlier this year .
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice president of the Court of Auditors
the Parliament &apos;s plenary voted on Wednesday the appointment of PSD ( Social Democrat Party ) senator Ilie Sarbu , Prime Minister Victor Ponta father in law , as vice president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors .
according to Mediafax , 290 votes &quot; for &quot; and 108 &quot; against &quot; were recorded .
the vote was made in secrecy , on bul@@ let@@ ins .
PNL ( National Liberal Party ) representatives were the only ones who voted against the proposal , inform@@ s digi@@ 24 .
in fact , the Liberals critic@@ iz@@ ed Sarbu &apos;s appointment to this position and announced that they would submit an appeal to the Romanian Constitutional Court , given that he has a DNA ( National Ant@@ icor@@ ruption Directorate ) file , and because he does not have appropriate expertise and experience .
SA@@ R@@ BU has 30 days by law to resign from the Senate because the new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to be involved in politics .
the PSD senator will occupy the vice @-@ president position of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors , remained vacant after Ioan Anton was revo@@ ked following a decision by the Constitutional Court in September 2014 , which found that his appointment was unconstitutional .
a surprise from one of the sex@@ iest actors : I grew up in the kitchen
as Brad@@ ley Cooper is to play the role of a chef in the movie &quot; Burn@@ t , &quot; the actor revealed something his female fans did not expect .
in a recent interview , he said that he mostly grew up in the kitchen : &quot; I have worked most of my life as a cook . &quot;
he revealed that he worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old , when he worked for a Greek restaurant , and then he went to college to continue on the same path .
the actor explained that his mother has Italian origins , so his entire childhood he has cooked with his Italian grandmother , reports Contact@@ music .
asked about his plans for the future during that period , Brad@@ ley Cooper said that he has never been the type of person to make five @-@ year plans , &quot; not even two . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not at all motiv@@ ating for me to have a map , &quot; he said .
&quot; I have dreams , things that you might laugh at if I told you , &quot; he added , but he later said that what he wanted since childhood came true .
reaching the age of 40 , the actor admitted , however , that he sees himself in the near future direc@@ ting , taking Cl@@ int East@@ wood &apos;s model , who started direc@@ ting at this age .
Ponta , accused of uncontrolled defam@@ ations and ir@@ rational statements
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to harshly condemned , on Wednesday morning , the statements of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to which the Hungarian polic@@ y@@ makers are &quot; no better than those in Syria , Libya or other fleeing refugee countries . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Victor Ponta has lost his self @-@ control and by his ir@@ rational statements is insulting all of Hungary , &quot; the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs stated in a press release .
civiliz@@ ed European politicians do not say such uncontrolled defam@@ ations .
&quot; his remarks have only one explanation : he has entirely lost his support in the Romanian domestic politics , &quot; added the head of the Hungarian diplomacy , according to MTI .
in a Facebook post from Tuesday evening , Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wants to draw attention to and sanction the behaviour of the Hungarian government officials , who , in his opinion , &quot; are a disgrace to the culture and values of the EU . &quot;
I do not want to respond to challenges from some Hungarian government representatives .
&quot; they are a disgrace for the culture and values of the EU , both due to their anti @-@ Semitic attitudes and treatment of all minorities and now during the refugees crisis , &quot; Ponta said on Facebook .
the Romanian Prime Minister added that he is an advocate of rational and sustainable solutions in case of the refugees crisis , saying that brut@@ ality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem .
barbed wire , aggressive laws , prisons and brut@@ ality certainly will not solve the problem - they will just show that in Hungary , in the heart of Europe , there are polic@@ y@@ makers no better than those in Syria , Libya and other fleeing refugee countries !
&quot; I believe in solidarity , in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the super@@ ior@@ ity of European values - what we see these days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these goals and values , &quot; stressed the head of the Romanian Government .
earlier on Tuesday , the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to , described as &quot; simple lies &quot; the remarks of the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the Hungarian management of the refugee crisis , saying that such statements are inappropriate for a leader of the XXI century , according to MTI .
the head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the &quot; extremist and false remarks &quot; of the Romanian Prime Minister are related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest is demanding an apology from Romania .
Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta .
what I said and have always said is that I am against xenophobic speeches , the idea to close the borders , that all those who come are terrorists are nonsense fit@@ ted for the Middle Ag@@ es and I totally oppose this approach .
if we can accommodate more , we will ; the problem is our log@@ istic ability to treat those people as people , and not as they are treated by our Hungarian neighbours , with violence and by &quot; marking &quot; them with serial numbers .
&quot; I cannot agree with such a thing , &quot; said Romanian Prime Minister in a press conference in Targu @-@ Jiu .
also on Tuesday , Peter Szij@@ j@@ ar@@ to announced that the Budapest Government has decided to start the preparations to extend the fence that is being built at the border with Serbia to the Romanian border as well , to cope with a possible change of the route used by migrants .
subsequently , Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that Hungary &apos;s decision to build a fence at the border does not solve the refugee issue and that it &quot; remov@@ es Hungary from Europe . &quot;
what is the link between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca cr@@ ane
Saudi authorities announced that the Saudi giant Bin@@ lad@@ in Group , belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden , is &quot; partly responsible &quot; for the collapse on Friday of a cr@@ ane on the Grand Mos@@ que of Mecca , accident which led to the death of 107 people .
according to an investigative committee , the company did not &quot; comply with the safety regulations , &quot; according to the Saudi press agency ( SPA ) , reports BBC .
company executi@@ ves have been banned from leaving the country pending inquir@@ ies in this case .
the company will also be excluded from new public contracts .
the Construction Company is owned by the family of the former leader of Al @-@ Qaida terrorist network , Osama bin Laden .
the company was founded by Osama bin Laden &apos;s father 80 years ago and is currently managed by the brother of the former terrorist leader , Bakr .
Bin@@ laden Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mos@@ que in order to accommodate more pilgrims .
the accident occurred Friday night during a storm when a cr@@ ane , probably un@@ balanced by strong blasts of wind , collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mos@@ que of Mecca .
following the accident , 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured .
how Hagi sil@@ enced compl@@ ain@@ ants
considered by many the greatest Romania football player in history , Gica Hagi , was lab@@ elled after his retirement as a weak coach who is not able to achieve high performance in the new position .
after unfortunate experiences with the national team , Steaua and Galatasaray , Hagi took over a year ago the coach position for Viitorul Constanta , the team he owns .
after exactly one year after taking over the team , the King proved that he is able to transform a team that was struggling to save itself from re@@ leg@@ ation into a top one .
so after one year , Viitorul recorded with Hagi as a coach , 16 victories , 11 ties and 11 defeats .
the balance is one of a top team fighting in the European Cup@@ s .
things have taken a turn for the better for Viitorul during this season , as the team came in second place in the National League with 19 points , one point less than the leader Astra Giurgiu .
Viitorul also has the best attack in the National League with 20 goals ( at a tie with Astra ) , more than double than Steaua .
on the other hand , even if he brought more experienced players to the team , Hagi continued its policy to promote young football players , and lately the starting team included names like Ianis Hagi or H@@ odor@@ og@@ ea .
the club &apos;s policy made Viitorul a team to be watched by foreign teams , and so Hagi has sold this summer in the amount of 1.5 million Eur@@ os - Ianis Hagi ( Fiorentina - 1 million euro ) and Alexandru Mitr@@ ita ( B@@ ari - 500 thousand euro ) .
along with Steaua , Viitorul is the only profitable team from the National League , according to the information from the Trade Register .
in the refugee crisis , Romania has played the role of a small country so far .
this is a legitimate strategy , but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU .
large countries shall come up with solutions for the entire EU , said Cristian Gh@@ inea , a member of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Centre for European Pol@@ icies .
in an interview given to Ziare.com , Cristian Gh@@ inea has stated that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress and pure polic@@ ing means will not work in this crisis : &quot; maybe we have doubts about the quality of values of these people . &quot;
but there are masses that have embarked on a path and we cannot und@@ o history .
migration is a reality to which we must adapt better but we must also adapt migrants to us .
in Cristian Gh@@ inea &apos;s opinion , we live in a highly emotional moment in which the politicians feel the need to show their mus@@ cles .
after it passes , Europeans will be willing to give up the freedom of movement , but the rules governing the Schengen area must be changed : &quot; Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was has not adjusted to the current situation . &quot;
what is our position in the refugee crisis after this JHA council which actually solved nothing ?
it is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote within the council .
all the forecasts say they had the necessary votes .
before the Lisbon Treaty , the JHA applied the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision .
therefore , very little was integrated in justice and home affairs .
after Lisbon , the normal procedure applies , the EC has the initiative , and the Council approves it with the vote of 55 % of the countries , namely 16 , which represents 65 % of the EU population .
the calculations stated that the votes existed .
but they did not want to go forward .
because it &apos;s a sensitive issue , even Germany rejected Chancellor Merkel &apos;s policy of openness and did not want other countries to see it as : &quot; EU thr@@ u@@ sts migrants upon us . &quot;
the matter was therefore postponed , but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will likely see big changes in the next period .
mandatory quotas were not really removed , but was the subject only allowed to further cool down ?
yes , on the other hand , ton@@ gu@@ es are w@@ ag@@ ging about greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders , which means a shift of responsibility from the individual member countries found near Schengen &apos;s ou@@ ter border to the Community agencies .
Greece &apos;s border with Turkey is actually Germany &apos;s border with Turkey , and this wave of migrants proved to be the limit for the old Schengen system .
maybe the Dublin principle will be dropped because it is not sustainable . this principle states that migrants are the responsibility of the State in which they have entered first .
if Greece over@@ turns , you cannot indefinitely sustain it &apos;s Greece &apos;s deal .
this is a common problem .
precisely because this is a common problem , is it possible to fix it without a precise mechanism , perhaps even a shared mandatory effort to receive the migrants ?
no one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work , if it comes to this .
a question still remains un@@ answered : what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal , but instead wants to go to Sweden or Germany ?
I do not think the European states will rush at the migrants : you will go to country X or country Y .
perhaps it will come to the creation of some unique filtr@@ ation centres in Greece or in Turkey where the refuge applications will be processed .
these kind of solutions are being conceived .
but the problem does not have a simple solution .
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants , there are countries with no experience as is the case of Romania , where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic trends .
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people in Turkey , Lebanon , Jordan , living in precarious camps and who are just beginning to head towards Europe .
one estimate says that only 10 % have managed to leave because it is hard cross the Mediterranean during winter , but next year we expect an even bigger migration wave .
what about these people ?
my predic@@ tion is that we &apos;ll get used to this problem and it will not seem so catastrophic in terms of media coverage .
you were talking about more or less experienced countries .
does it seem like there are some places that have really managed to integrate large groups coming from a non @-@ European culture ?
I see the Mag@@ hre@@ bi@@ ans in France , Turks in Germany , they are also land@@ locked .
I would not make radical statements .
of course , their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration , but that does not mean they are not integrated at all .
there are still some who remain un@@ integrated , creating maj@@ our social problems in France , Germany , UK .
but pure polic@@ ing means will not work .
to create a fortress out of Europe is an ill@@ us@@ ory concept .
we have to develop the mechanisms of integration in European societies .
some mistakes have been made in this area .
we must be more demanding .
we must ask these people to learn the language , try to appropriate our values , to stop having one foot in Europe and one in their home country , bringing the rest of the family including through marri@@ ages of conven@@ ience .
however , we must separate the imminent problem created by these people from the long term problem of their integration .
if others have failed in long @-@ term integration that doesn &apos;t mean that we have to watch them dro@@ wn in the Mediterranean .
maybe we have doubts about the quality of values of these people .
and if there is going to be an intervention in Syria , which I don &apos;t think will ever happen , that does not mean that the country will recover overnight and you can send them back .
until solutions are created , we will see fort@@ res@@ ses in Europe .
the borders are closed , walls are being risen , border controls are being re@@ introduced in the Schengen area .
is the European project being threatened ?
the European project per se is not , but the former organisation form of the Schengen area is .
it was built quite minim@@ alistic and its rules put too much pressure on the countries in which these migrants step foot in for the first time .
I mean we are free to r@@ ove , but each with their own problems .
we cannot continue like this when we are faced with this migration wave , because some countries cannot handle it .
when these kind of emotion waves arise , politicians want to show that they are doing something , but in the long run not much is changed .
after the attacks in France we do not have a much more dr@@ acon@@ ian anti @-@ terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year .
it &apos;s a wave of public emotion that goes both ways .
the emotion is so unstable from one week to another that you cannot base your decisions on it .
we hear discussions , more bel@@ lic@@ ose statements from politicians who are at home and feel the pressure of being vir@@ ile .
and then , the dramatic case of the child that drowned in Turkey happens and strikes a ch@@ ord in the public opinion .
after the public emotion passes , we will return to the reasons we have created this space , the freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods .
this is the true single European market .
and I do not think that the Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement .
the fact that there are going to be different rules is a totally different thing .
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was has not adjusted to the current situation .
what was Romania &apos;s role in this crisis so far ?
as a small country , Romania believes that if it covers its eyes and ears , the situation will disappear .
in the reality of migration waves , you can choose to be part of the solution or say that this is not your problem as a small country .
this was our policy and it &apos;s a legitimate strategy , but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU .
if you are not involved , you cannot be treated as other big countries .
big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU , good or bad , we are not discussing their quality now .
as did Poland .
on the other hand , the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians &apos; appetite for Schengen will greatly decrease .
President iohannis says that maybe it &apos;s a good thing that Romania is not yet part of Schengen .
so we find ourselves in a transition from the despair to join to a more pragmatic position , but the goal still remains .
if Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen , there is of course the risk to be considered as an alternative route by the migrants .
this is not a reason for not joining Schengen , but a reason to be more pragmatic .
Romania will be part of Schengen and the Schengen will exist , but it will be transformed in the sense that the external borders will become common responsibility , there will be unique rules of acceptance of the migrants , unique rules of deport@@ ation for those who do not receive refuge , unique rules for countries considered safe .
the Ukrainian President stated that after Russia shif@@ ted its attention to Syria , there were no more deaths in the Ukraine .
is there a link between the two out@@ breaks , one of Russia &apos;s games ?
Russia beh@@ aves like a frustrated power .
it believes that being a great power means misleading Americans and Europeans .
from this point of view , yes , there is a connection .
without the financial and military effort of the Putin regime , the Assad regime would likely have collapsed long ago .
its crash would have been a good thing if it happened before its main opponent became the Islamic State .
a battle between the Assad regime and the la@@ ic and moderate Muslim mil@@ iti@@ as , backed by the Gulf and Western countries , was fought for a couple of years .
then the Islamic State has risen and we no longer know if we want the Assad regime to fall .
Russia could have complicated things , but cannot participate in the solution .
it creates instability and chaos out@@ breaks which it cannot bring to an end .
you are a great power only if you have solutions .
the off @-@ side play is just a strategy to save time .
perhaps Putin expects to receive offers , to press but@@ t@@ ons in order to resolve the situation .
the offers do not come because the rest of the world is not convinced that he can solve the issues created by him one way or another .
but I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are driven by an invisible hand .
let &apos;s not look at Putin and see him stronger than he actually is .
a new button will appear soon
millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the &quot; Like &quot; button , and the social network &apos;s representatives are preparing an opposed one , the &quot; Dis@@ like &quot; button .
Tuesday , Mark Zuckerberg , co @-@ founder and chief executive of the company , announced on his account that this button will be available soon , inform@@ s New York Times on its blog .
Zuckerberg said that the &quot; Dis@@ like &quot; button will look more like a sh@@ ade of what a user feels than a simple option .
however , the announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friend@@ lier place .
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid times when someone posts on his / her account an important event in his / her life , and someone else will hit the &quot; Dis@@ like &quot; button .
the network &apos;s users , which reached 1.5 billion active accounts , have long called for the opportunity to express negative emotions or emp@@ ath@@ y with something sad .
mark Zuckerberg has said it is not very comfortable for people to give &quot; Like &quot; to current events , such as the refugee crisis , or in the case of a death of a family member .
&quot; it may not feel comfortable hitting Like for that post , &quot; said the Facebook representative .
the variant of a new button on Facebook was not received well by everyone .
&quot; there is already enough hate on Facebook and social networks , &quot; said A@@ ti@@ q H@@ ane@@ ef in Afghanistan , on the Facebook page of the New York Times , where the article on this subject was posted .
&quot; I &apos;ll &quot; Dis@@ like &quot; the &quot; Dis@@ like &quot; button , &quot; he said .
Roger Anderson , a micro@@ bi@@ ologist from Atlanta , said that there is nothing wrong with this button , encouraging people to have different views on Facebook .
D@@ ebr@@ a Ah@@ o Willi@@ am@@ son , an e@@ Mark@@ eter social media analyst , said it is hard to imagine that one button can transmit a comprehensive range of negative emotions .
moreover , she says , the election campaign in America is approaching , and the &quot; Dis@@ like &quot; button would create a total disaster .
only 70 refugees came to Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday , a handful out of the thousands that come at its southern border with Serbia , said Government Ad@@ vis@@ er Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ ond@@ i .
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along its border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees , closing a key border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on the border with Romania , DPA recalls .
the measure drew a sharp reaction from Serbia .
just yesterday they said they would se@@ al the border for those who want to pass , not for those who wish to seek asylum .
&quot; as you can see , this is totally different , &quot; said Serbian Minister for Refugees , Aleksandar Vul@@ in .
before imposing the new immigration legislation , a record number of 5,@@ 8@@ 09 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday , announced the police on Monday .
in addition , more than 17@@ 0,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa broke into Hungary from Serbia in 2015 .
many avoid being registered and try to reach the West , especially in Germany .
the &quot; new &quot; headquarters of the County Council is about to collapse .
two builders in insolvency
massive investments made here in recent years to re@@ locate the headquarters of the institution are about to cr@@ um@@ ble because they were stopped several times .
two maj@@ our builders who performed the works there became insolv@@ ent during work .
the County Council headquarters located in Vasile Alecsandri street will eventually cr@@ um@@ ble by itself .
after a year and a half since the consolidation and ref@@ unc@@ tion@@ alisation works should have been completed , the works are not even half completed .
a final stage in the building saga developed these passed days when the National Council for C@@ laim@@ s S@@ et@@ tlement ( CN@@ SC ) has rejected a complaint from the company which intended to take over the contract for the implementation of the technical project related to the work still to be executed .
the initial draft was prepared by Impex Rom@@ catel SA .
after the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of work , negotiation procedures were initiated with Impex Rom@@ catel without the publication of a contract notice . the company was going to update the technical design , and then a new tender for works would have been issued .
&quot; the negotiations did not result in signing of a contract , as the County Council considered that the proposed project would not be profitable for the institution , &quot; stated Razvan Timof@@ ci@@ uc , the public relations representative of the County Council .
the County Council &apos;s decision to dis@@ continue direct negotiations was sued by Impex Rom@@ catel .
the Iasi Court sent the complaint to the CN@@ SC , who dismissed it due to being late .
this does not mean that the County Council can start searching for another designer .
Impex Rom@@ catel has the opportunity to appeal against the decision of CN@@ SC . another designer can be considered only after a final judg@@ ement has been issued by the Court of Appe@@ al .
thus , the consolidation of the building could resume as early as next year .
our intention is to resume work as soon as possible .
as a general principle , the re@@ drafting of the technical project should not take long , but we must conclude a contract .
&quot; we are waiting to see if the decision of CN@@ SC will be appealed or not , &quot; said Timof@@ ci@@ uc .
the consolidation of the former police headquarters began in 2011 .
the first works contract was terminated in April 2012 , after 4.5 million lei had been spent on construction works .
the tender resumed and the contract was awarded to Mol@@ do@@ construct SA .
the company became insolv@@ ent and this contract was also terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made .
the works performed so far represent approximately 50 % of the total works .
initially , the consolidation , ref@@ unc@@ tion@@ alisation and at@@ tic conversion works of the building have been evaluated at 7.@@ 7 million lei .
&quot; ok@@ ay , I will tell you everything ! &quot; - A statement that might incrimin@@ ate the former head of the Cad@@ astre Office
one of the employees involved in the scandalous case of the Cad@@ astre Office signed an agreement recogn@@ iz@@ ing the facts , in exchange for defer@@ red prison .
most likely , his statements will incrimin@@ ate the other defendants , together with the former head , Narc@@ iza Nedelcu
a member of the Office of Cad@@ astre and Land Registr@@ ation ( O@@ CPI ) of I@@ a@@ ș@@ i county accused by DNA ( National Ant@@ icor@@ ruption Directorate ) in a corruption case admitted his actions .
the Agreement recognising the facts signed by Dumitru D@@ asc@@ ă@@ lu was recorded yesterday at Iasi Court and the judges agreed to give a resolution in this case on September 29 .
Dumitru Daniel D@@ ascal@@ u was charged with forgery in repeated form and agreed to do two years in prison with defer@@ ment and community work .
regarding the alleged acts of D@@ ascal@@ u , the prosecutors said that , as adviser within the Office of Cad@@ astre , together with other colleagues , he &quot; has for@@ ged several minutes of acceptance on service contracts prior@@ ly concluded by O@@ CPI of I@@ a@@ ș@@ i county with the directors of SC Ga@@ uss SRL , SC Grup C@@ inci SRL , SC Top@@ o Euro C@@ ad SRL , SC Ag@@ en@@ ț@@ ia de Cad@@ astru ș@@ i Top@@ ografie SRL and PFA Lip@@ ș@@ a Ș@@ t@@ ef@@ an att@@ est@@ ing the false fact that the contracted services have been performed in full , although they were not carried out and were not submitted to O@@ CPI of I@@ a@@ ș@@ i county ;
a few days ago , the former head of the Office Narc@@ iza Nedelcu , and other former or current O@@ CPI employees were prosecuted in this case , being accused of paying for services charged by the mentioned companies , although the works were never carried out .
the damage exceeds 300,000 lei .
advent@@ ures in the Stone Age
according the President of the Romanian Handball Federation , Alexandru Dedu , Romania can only host a maj@@ our handball tournament in 20@@ 24 , and the women &apos;s handball national team training for the Olympics qualifications costs a fortune .
the President of the Romanian Handball Federation , Alexandru Dedu , stated yesterday during a meeting with the press , that there is great pride in the fact that our country has three teams in the Champions League .
regarding the women &apos;s national handball team , &quot; the main objective is the qualification for the Olympic Games in Rio , but in order to achieve this goal , the team must pass two ga@@ unt@@ lets , firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre@@ qualification tournament &quot; added Dedu .
we very much want to qualify for the Olympics .
there are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde .
staff which will be formed of seven or eight people .
he wants a deputy coach , a physician , two mas@@ se@@ urs , goal@@ keepers coach , physical coach , head of delegation .
they asked certain things in order to obtain the qualification , namely materials for physical training of which I have never heard .
all this to get to the Olympics and I will do all I can to obtain them .
we &apos;re talking about a massive investment , about a lot of money .
but this is the way to excellence .
because at this time , our training is like in the Stone Age .
&quot; the teams we compete with have these materials and they have had them for some time , &quot; said Dedu , who also mentioned that he is trying to obtain the amounts needed to purchase these products from the Ministry of Youth and Sport and the Sport and Olympics Romanian Committee .
the president of the Romanian Handball Federation also referred to the Romanian infrastructure and the opportunity for our country to host a maj@@ our handball competition .
we do not have a gy@@ m in Bucharest .
it is a matter of infrastructure and it is shameful to think about a European Gym@@ nastics Championship .
let us not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic districts were built from scratch within two years .
until 1992 , the current Barcelona Olympic area was a land@@ fill , and now it has become a landmark of beauty .
the same happened in London , where the organiz@@ ation of the Olympics in 2012 was a success in terms of investments .
&quot; in my opinion , we can host a maj@@ our competition in 20@@ 24 , &quot; concluded Dedu .
he added that the international handball bodies are willing to give Romania the chance to organiz@@ e a maj@@ our competition .
for me it &apos;s a priority to bring maj@@ our handball competitions in Romania .
Mr . G@@ atu went with a project in a civiliz@@ ed manner and many have agreed in principle with it but they soon learned that the hall will never be built .
I have also had discussions with the E@@ H@@ F , I told them that we are willing , that we are able to organiz@@ e such a competition and they said that they agree and that we should invite them to the first match in the new Bucharest hall so we can discuss in concrete terms afterwards .
&quot; so E@@ H@@ F and I@@ H@@ F are both open to the idea , but we have no infrastructure &quot; the R@@ H@@ F official explained .
the great former handball player avoided to evaluate the chances of the women &apos;s teams CSM Bucuresti and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four : &quot; I have asked all coaches to be reserved in making forecasts , because if they do not happen , it will prejudice them . &quot;
a safe journey to the World Cup

14 million lei given to &quot; SF . Spiridon &quot; Hospital at the budget adjustment
what will this amount of money be used for ?
&quot; SF . Spiridon &quot; Hospital received from the Ministry of Health , following the budget adjustment , about 14 million lei .
the money received by the medical unit to be used until the end of the year will be invested in modern@@ iz@@ ation and planning works of some clinics , but also for equipment and medical technology for which the hospital has already initiated the procurement procedure .
the health unit will thus be equipped with a new Tom@@ ography Comput@@ er , a new X @-@ ray device , six surgery k@@ its , six IC@@ U beds properly equipped , an oph@@ th@@ al@@ m@@ ologic mic@@ ros@@ cope and other equipment necessary to conduct the medical activity .
on the other hand , 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and planning of &quot; Marele Ar@@ s &quot; ( The Great Burn@@ t ) .
from the money coming from the budget adjustment , the ER will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modern@@ iz@@ ation works in the main section .
&quot; in addition , in the coming days we will accept the works from the bridge linking the ER to the cardi@@ ology , Hep@@ at@@ ology and g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology clinics to ensure the proper transfer of patients from the ER to the neighbouring clinics &quot; explained the manager of the medical unit .
the Hospital will soon have the T@@ ă@@ t@@ ă@@ ra@@ ș@@ i Der@@ mat@@ ology Clinic in its premises , which will be managed in ambul@@ atory , in the form as it currently operates .
the clinic will operate in the area where the ambul@@ atory all@@ ergy , ha@@ emat@@ ology and En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ology sections are and will have around 30 beds .
Iasi , embar@@ ras@@ sed by the Autonom@@ ous Administration of Public Transport controllers and a lea@@ fl@@ et .
the adventure of a tourist
a family of tourists from Cluj came to visit Iasi , but the trip ended with a bitter promise .
after this experience , my wife and I never want to set foot in your city .
un@@ will@@ ingly , they faced false information from lea@@ fl@@ ets , the rud@@ eness of the controllers of the Autonom@@ ous Administration of Public Transport ( RATP ) and a fine as a bonus &quot; because the law says so . &quot;
the couple arrived in Iasi a few days ago , they checked into a hotel and asked for tourist lea@@ fl@@ ets .
they also received a lea@@ fl@@ et with the RATP routes .
&quot; armed &quot; with these maps , the spouses visited Iasi .
but two days ago , while they were in Copou , they wanted to go to Palas Mall .
since there was not a ticket bo@@ oth in the station near Copou park , they reli@@ ed on the information printed on the lea@@ fl@@ et : they can buy a ticket by SMS .
no one told them that this service no longer exists .
confident in the lea@@ fl@@ et , they boar@@ ded the bus and tried to send a SMS following the instructions on the lea@@ fl@@ et .
unfortunately for them , a RATP control team showed up .
they said the service no longer exists for 2 years and that the press announced it has been cancelled .
how AM I supposed TO know what was written in the local press , since I came to visit the city a night ago ?
I spoke with the controllers , we explained the situation and they said they do not care , it &apos;s not their job .
the attitude was very de@@ fi@@ ant .
they said all they can do is give us just one fine instead of two ( for my wife and myself ) .
&quot; I paid , I did not want to ruin my site seeing day at the gendarm@@ erie giving statements ! &quot; says Ovidiu .
in conclusion , the family was fined due to the err@@ on@@ eous information from the lea@@ fl@@ et and the controllers &quot; who applied the law to the letter . &quot;
this is not right , and I made a refer@@ ral to RATP Iasi to recover my money .
it &apos;s not about the money , the amount was not that great , but the fact is that I felt che@@ ated on .
bad luck for the rapists of Vaslui .
they had an accident and remained in custody
the trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui was transferred , yesterday , to the Court of Appe@@ al I@@ a@@ ș@@ i .
the Magistr@@ ates of Iasi county settled the first hearing in a closed session in which the seven y@@ ou@@ ths were accused of rap@@ ing a young woman aged 18 , requested to be set free .
before starting the actual hearing , one of the judges from Iasi county who had been assigned the case , Viorel Munteanu , made a request for ab@@ sten@@ tion , which was accepted by his colleagues .
the magistrate worked until this summer at Vaslui Court , where he was the president of the Criminal Section , and he is the one who , on April 9 admitted an appeal brought by four of the defendants , ord@@ ering their placement under house arrest .
currently , the case is judged by a panel that includes the magistrates Mar@@ ic@@ ica Mititelu and G@@ eta Sandu .
judge Dan Anton also made a request for ab@@ sten@@ tion earlier in the case , because his daughter is in a relationship of co@@ hab@@ itation with one of the rapists &apos; lawyers .
the two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in custody .
the young men will remain imprisoned for at least 30 days , period after which the judges will re @-@ discuss the possibility of setting them free .
the next hearing will be held at the Court of Appe@@ al of Iasi county on October 6 .
before arriving at the Court of Appe@@ al of Iasi , the van transporting the rapists from Vaslui was involved in an accident in P@@ ă@@ cur@@ ari district as the car was entering Iasi city through the bel@@ tw@@ ay .
the I@@ vec@@ o van that transported the seven rapists was hit by a Volkswagen that came from CAN@@ TA Street whose driver tried to turn left .
the van was coming from the end of P@@ ă@@ cur@@ ari .
the car came this way because the Pr@@ ison Administration employees preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi which passed the location of Gr@@ aj@@ duri and then they entered on the bel@@ tw@@ ay .
in this way , the road was shor@@ tened by a few kilometres .
immediately after the impact , the prisoners &apos; escor@@ t called for another transport to take the prisoners .
soon , at the accident scene , arrived a car sent from the Iasi Maxim@@ um Security Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appe@@ al .
following the accident , none of the prisoners was injured .
to transfer them into the other van , the guards surrounded the back of the cars and the prisoners came out fast by t@@ wo@@ s .
&quot; the incident was not reported to the Police because the drivers of the two cars have amic@@ ably agreed on the damages to be paid , &quot; stated Chief Commissioner M@@ ă@@ d@@ ă@@ lin Ț@@ ă@@ r@@ anu of the County Police Inspectorate .
the great migr@@ ations
Romania is not nor will it be ever be ready for what comes next .
what about Europe ?
I &apos;m going to say this from the beginning , loud and clear : the approxim@@ ate 7,000 refugees who should be and have to be natur@@ alised by Romania is in itself an in@@ significant number , but a huge one compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage this kind of project .
for Romania , even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest , amounting to about 1,500 so@@ ul@@ s , sur@@ passes by far our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months .
certainly , if those migrants will accept to settle in our cities , the chances of a quick integration in the Romanian society are extraordin@@ arily small .
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience .
suc@@ ked dry by the paras@@ ites of the under@@ world gangs and by a ven@@ al political class , the Romanian State proves to be impot@@ ent in all areas .
failure to integrate the Gy@@ psi@@ es is just a trivial example .
besides , governments of any colour were not able to absorb European funds to build roads , kind@@ er@@ gar@@ tens or modern schools , provide decent health care , collect the garbage of the streets , create dec@@ ently paid jobs or prevent its young generation from leaving the country .
why would a refugee settle in a country similar to the one he &apos;s running away from ?
but what is particularly surprising is the hypocrisy displayed when dealing with such a crisis .
firstly , we come into contact with the hypocrisy of the bel@@ lic@@ ose powerful countries of the EU , which are especially generous when it comes to sharing their trou@@ bles with smaller countries .
the second thing is the Romanians &apos; hypocr@@ itical fear . although Romanians have millions of relatives sc@@ attered all over the world , they still do not accept the person next to them - the one speaking a different language , having a different religion or just because he has different blood running through his ve@@ ins .
we are probably afraid that someone will steal our national identity .
in the end , there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who , although only invo@@ ke the horr@@ ors of war as a reason for leaving , do not accept another destination of their exod@@ us other than Germany or the Nordic countries .
however , not all refugees are Syrian , and Pakistan is not at war .
furthermore , the simple way of analysing the crisis can only be d@@ eri@@ ded .
some argue that the causes must be eliminated strictly rel@@ ying on political correc@@ t@@ ness , asking for peace and investments in the migrants &apos; home countries .
but Romania is at peace and occas@@ ionally , some foreign capital is inj@@ ected in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving the country every year .
why do they leave ?
in this crisis , the European Union has revealed to be a stif@@ f , divided and overwhel@@ med structure .
we express criticism about the fact that Romania is not able to inv@@ ent a project for the country , but we see that the EU also doesn &apos;t have any plans for the future .
improv@@ isations and threats will not help .
considering the above , what is the use of the EU , if the only advantage enjoyed by the Romanians - freedom of movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders with no effort whatsoever ?
at one point , the war in Syria will end .
the migrant crisis will not .
in the following decades , over@@ population , poverty , climate change , resource depl@@ etion , etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to a better life .
with such politicians , Romania is not nor will it be ever be ready for what comes next .
7,000 Euro per year to rent Pog@@ or Club .
the destination is practically imposed
the tender for concession covers 10 years .
after 7 years in which it remained closed , the club from the Romanian Literature Museum &apos;s cour@@ ty@@ ard is offered by the County Council to be le@@ ased for a period of 10 years .
the building has a net area of 134 square meters on two levels of cel@@ l@@ ars .
the County Council accepts as destinations for the building only literary caf@@ e , book@@ store or other cultural activities .
the building was valued at 6@@ 8,@@ 300 euros , and the auc@@ tion value beings at 6.@@ 8@@ 30 euros per year , with a bid@@ ding step of 25 euros .
the conces@@ sion@@ aire will have to use the building continuously and consistently and cover all the costs of rehabilitation , according to the technical project to be drafted .
&quot; Pog@@ or Club Buil@@ ding is highly deterior@@ ated because during the time in which the catering unit function@@ ed in this spaces or there@@ after current repairs and maintenance works were not carried out as required during the operation of a building , &quot; is stated in the ten@@ der@@ ing procedure documentation .
the concession offers for the club can be submitted by September 18 .

they found the p@@ ills lying around and took them out of curiosity .

the children were rushed to &quot; Sfanta Maria &quot; hospital in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i .
their condition is stable , state the doctors .
exclusive : a meeting that will break your heart .
at the age 20 she received a brave gift : her biological parents
lost in the hospital under unclear circumstances in the mis@@ t of the 9@@ 0s , when she was only two months old , tiny ill and hel@@ pl@@ ess , she was adopted by a wealthy family form Italy . during this time , the adoption laws in Romania were lo@@ os@@ ely regulated . the young girl from I@@ a@@ ș@@ i who is now a beautiful blon@@ de girl , was reun@@ ited with their biological parents in a village of the county after nearly two decades in which neither her or her biological parents new nothing about one another .
Cr@@ ina will turn 20 a few days from now , and her adop@@ tive parents in Pal@@ ermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a courageous and stag@@ gering gift : a visit to Romania , to I@@ a@@ ș@@ i , to learn about her unclear past .
&quot; Ziarul de Iasi &quot; assisted in the efforts to find a family based on a few extremely vague clu@@ es , witnessed these meetings which basically broke our hearts .
the story of the reporters , the emotions , the statements of those involved and their reactions are down@@ right po@@ ign@@ ant and overwhelming .
Cr@@ ina &apos;s story begins 20 years ago in the town of Rug@@ inoasa of I@@ a@@ ș@@ i county , when she was only two months old .
due to health problems , the girl had to be hospit@@ aliz@@ ed in the city .
at home , dis@@ agreements between the parents started to arise and the mother had to leave the residence .
the father decided to keep the girl and to drive me away from home .
he kept the girl , and after that I lost all contact .
&quot; when I found out that she was in the hospital , it was too late , &quot; recalls Alina griev@@ ing , the biological mother of the girl .
Cr@@ ina and her grandmother were admitted to the hospital of the municipality of Pa@@ ș@@ cani , and on the same day her father , Cost@@ ica Bal@@ can went to work in the city of Alexandria , Teleorman County .
their lives would forever part ways .
they did not find Cr@@ ina at the hospital .
after admission , Cr@@ ina &apos;s father went to work in another town and returned after six months .
meanwhile , the girl was transferred to the hospital in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i and when the father came back he co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t find her .
I think almost nine months had passed since the girl was hospit@@ aliz@@ ed .
&quot; maybe she thought she was been abandoned , &quot; says a ni@@ ece of the family .
because of financial problems , the grandmother could not go with Cr@@ ina to I@@ a@@ ș@@ i and the girl remained in the care of the doctors .
because during all this time nobody came to ask about the fate of the child , she was taken by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i , who then gave her to the F@@ ost@@ er Care Centre in buc@@ ium .
during that period , abandon@@ ment and adoption were more ligh@@ tly regulated in comparison to today &apos;s regulations in Romania .
the child was found in the centre in buc@@ ium by an Italian , Salv@@ ator@@ e and his wife , a couple from Pal@@ ermo who wanted to have their own child but could not .
they fell in love with blon@@ de Cr@@ ina , and after some time she moved to Italy with them .
the little girl had turned almost two when the adoption form@@ alities were completed .
when I saw Cr@@ ina , I felt she &apos;s our girl .
&quot; it was like my wife had given birth to her , &quot; says Salv@@ ad@@ ore , the adop@@ tive father , smiling , while his hand c@@ aches the girl &apos;s fr@@ ail hand .
at home , Cr@@ ina &apos;s parents , Alina and Cost@@ ic@@ ă continued to search separately , wherever they were able to .
the father questioned the authorities of Rug@@ inoasa , but received no reply about the where@@ ab@@ outs of his child .
the police then informed him that she may be deceased , but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i .
when I sought her here , the Court told me that she is in Italy , Pal@@ ermo .
I co@@ ul@@ dn &apos;t look for her anymore .
we pr@@ ayed to God to keep her safe .
I thought of her all the years , but we did not have the possibility to find her .
&quot; it &apos;s hard , &quot; says the biological mother of Cr@@ ina with tears in her eyes .
however , even if the years passed , the parents from Rug@@ inoasa were never forgotten .
in Italy , Salv@@ ator@@ e and his wife explained to the girl about her origins and that her past links her to Romania .
I was just a little girl when I found out .
I think I was five or six .
I reacted just like a child , I was curious .
&quot; I wanted to meet my parents from Romania , &quot; says Cr@@ ina delighted .
her dream was going to come true .
this March , Chief Commissioner Rom@@ ic@@ ă IC@@ H@@ IM , the Regional Director of the Centre for Prevention , As@@ s@@ ess@@ ment and Coun@@ selling in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i , was contacted by an acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance in Italy , who explained Salv@@ ad@@ ore &apos;s desire to find Cr@@ ina &apos;s biological family .
the search began with just a name .
after the request from our partners in Italy , we began taking the first steps .
I only received a name , Bal@@ can Cost@@ ica , then the name of the town , Rug@@ inoasa .
shortly after that I conducted a business with the city hall of Rug@@ inoasa , and I had the possibility to ask whether the name I received was familiar to the locals .
then they gave me some point@@ ers , only to find that the person I was directed to wasn &apos;t he person I was looking for .
&quot; it took about a month to find the girl &apos;s biological father , &quot; explains Chief Commissioner Rom@@ ic@@ ă IC@@ H@@ IM .
in total , the authorities needed more than three months to find Cost@@ ic@@ ă and Alina , especially since each of them was domic@@ iled in another loc@@ ality .
we started work somewhere in March and in June @-@ July we completed the identification of the biological parents and concluded the discussions .
&quot; then we decided that the first meeting will take place in September , &quot; added Rom@@ ic@@ ă IC@@ H@@ IM .
last weekend , Alina and Cost@@ ic@@ ă saw the girl who was lost on the halls of the hospital in Iasi for the first time in 20 years .
the father was excited and barely able to control his tears and his hands were shaking inc@@ ess@@ antly .
he barely ex@@ changed a few words with the people around him .
a week before the meeting he had@@ n &apos;t really been able to sleep .
he was all excited , shaking .
&quot; it &apos;s something extraordinary to see your baby after so many years , &quot; says a ni@@ ece who came with Cost@@ ic@@ ă from Rug@@ inoasa .
meeting between Cr@@ ina and her biological mother and brother
while talking to his daughter , who is going to study at a top universities in Italy , Cost@@ ica Bal@@ can said , among other things , that if his daughter ever wanted to return to him in the village , she could come at any time : he can give her some sheep , goats , she can find a man from the village and start a household .
her mother is also emotional , cr@@ ies , and she can hardly believe such a thing could happen to her .
I &apos;m very nervous .
I could not believe something like this could happen .
I &apos;ve seen such cases only on TV , I kept thinking about her all these years , I hoped , but I never thought it could happen to me .
I am very nervous .
if she could only forgive me .
I hope that we can visit each other in the future .
&quot; I hope we can stay in contact , &quot; says Alina with big tears on her che@@ eks , Cr@@ ina &apos;s mother , while holding a nap@@ kin tight in her hand .
she hides her tears of happiness in that nap@@ kin , because soon she will see her daughter after so long .
on the other side , Cr@@ ina , whose birthday is in just a few days from now , is turning 20 and she &apos;s trying to calm h@@ ers@@ el@@ f just like an emotional child .
she has no idea of what to expect , but has a vague idea about her biological parents .
she thinks they &apos;re young , but now before the meeting she tries to gather her thoughts , because she has so much to say , but nothing to reproach .
my parents are two mothers and two fathers .
but in the end , my parents are the ones who raised me .
it will be a nice meeting , a wonderful experience .
&quot; I hope to gain a beautiful memory after meeting them , because now there are so many things to say , &quot; conf@@ esses Cr@@ ina .
the first family reun@@ ion in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i
in Pi@@ a@@ ț@@ a Unirii , bene@@ ath the autumn sky , the family from Rug@@ inoasa jo@@ ins their destiny with their daughter in Pal@@ ermo .
Cr@@ ina is now 20 , she &apos;s finishing high school according to the Italian school system , but she has the opportunity to begin a new chapter with Alina and Costel , her biological parents .
there are no more borders or countries separ@@ ating them , just one barrier : the language .
this barrier is easily broken with the help of an interpre@@ ter , a local Italian owner whose establishment is located in the centre of I@@ a@@ ș@@ i .
those who managed to make this meeting possible say this is the first event of its kind , and that in the future , if they will have another chance to make it happen , they will do it .
it is the first event of this kind with such amount of emotion , and I &apos;m glad it &apos;s a success .
the centre we work at conduc@@ ts various activities and most times we are associated with an institution that only deals with drug consumers or add@@ ic@@ ts .
but we try to give something good back to the community .
&quot; if I will ever be asked to participate in such activities , I will do it with all my heart , &quot; says Rom@@ ic@@ ă IC@@ H@@ IM smiling , the director of the Regional Centre for Prevention , As@@ s@@ ess@@ ment and Coun@@ selling in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i .
behind him , the Bal@@ can family with Cr@@ ina in the middle walk away telling stories .
it &apos;s quite understandable : they have much to say to each other .
temporary truc@@ e , yesterday at PSD ( Social Democrat Party ) .
everyone can catch their breath
the sides of PSD Branc@@ h of Iasi county concluded a temporary truc@@ e .
after multiple discussion sessions , held from Friday to Sunday , the first being the most tense , PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend host@@ il@@ ities .
forced by the party &apos;s executive president , Liviu Dragnea , to present a unified position , the Social Democrats of Iasi county will send a whole list of potential candidates for the party &apos;s positions .
far from being over , the party &apos;s internal war seems to be on a break to allow combatants to catch their breath .
Dragnea has not given an ultimatum .
he sent a very simple and timely message under current circumstances : try to find a solution in order not to je@@ op@@ ard@@ ize the party .
on October 3 we have elections within the party .
all the positions will be made available to those who want them .
&quot; until then , we remain in the existing structure , &quot; said Ac@@ ting Mayor Mihai Chirica .
the two days of discussions over the weekend led only to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established .
at the October elections for the presidency of the county branch of PSD a fierce competition is to be expected .
on the short list of possible candidates for the main position of the Iasi branch of the party is the Secretary of state Mar@@ icel Popa , Senator Florin Constantinescu , Senator Sorin Lazar , county council@@ lor Vasile C@@ â@@ tea and Ac@@ ting President of the County Council , Vic@@ to@@ rel Lupu .
the mayor of Sch@@ itu D@@ uca comm@@ une , Mihai Mihalache , can also be added .
the candidacy of PSD county councillors leader Cristian ST@@ AN@@ CI@@ U can also be a variant , if Lupu does not enter the race , as sources within the party say he is not interested in the position .
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of recent days is that of the former head of the branch , Mayor Gheorghe Nichita .
the list of candidates is open .
according to the statute , applications may be submitted including in the election day and no one would be surprised if it happened .
&quot; it is important we remain united and will remain so after October 3 , when we shall have a new Executive Office , a new Permanent County Office and new leadership structures , &quot; stated C@@ â@@ tea .
until the organisation of internal elections , the management of PSD county branch will be provided by Vic@@ to@@ rel Lupu , a close friend of Nichita and ST@@ AN@@ CI@@ U .
Lupu is still on vacation until September 29 , the preparation of the elections being actually provided by the branch executive secretary , county council@@ lor Mihail Popescu , who is not in the best terms with Nichita &apos;s followers .
contacted by telephone , Cristian ST@@ AN@@ CI@@ U stated that the recent discussions led to &quot; a partial agreement . &quot;
there is a wide openness to maintain balance and unity in the party .
a partial consensus was reached to support a unified team to manage the county .
&quot; but on the other hand , there are many vari@@ ants on the PSD presidential candidacy intentions in I@@ a@@ ș@@ i county , as the list is still open , &quot; said ST@@ AN@@ CI@@ U .
a judge from Iasi rejected the file of the rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of con@@ cu@@ bin@@ age
the seven young@@ sters from Vaslui convicted of rape shell be heard today by the Court of Appe@@ al Iasi .
the rapists whose sentences range from five years and eight months to eight years and four months will present arguments concerning their freedom today , after the trial court of Vaslui has requested their immediate incarcer@@ ation after the sent@@ encing .
the case was registered at the Court of Appe@@ al last week , magistrate Dan Anton formul@@ ating a request of ab@@ sten@@ tion which was admitted by his colleagues .
Anton claimed that one of the lawyers of the defendants , attorney Bogdan Luca , is the con@@ cu@@ bine of his daughter , attorney Dana Anton .
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Bur@@ ada , who received the highest penalty in this case .
how the judges motivated their sentence
last weekend , the magistrate of Vaslui Court who convicted the seven young@@ sters motivated his sentence .
in his motivation , the judge speaks of the de@@ fi@@ ant reaction of the defendants , but also of those who supported them , stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public .
&quot; the court finds that after the moment the judicial control was placed under preventive measure , the measure of liber@@ ty restriction but not liber@@ ty depriv@@ ation , due to the impact of the attitude of the defendants and their families and local supporters , was felt in the local and national community as a strong sense of indignation regarding the fact that the individuals accused of serious off@@ en@@ ses are tried under a less restrictive measure , &quot; states the motivation of the Vaslui Court .
also , the magistrates ruled out the main defence of the seven defendants who , during the process , invo@@ ked that the girl they raped wasn &apos;t &quot; quite a clean potato . &quot;
&quot; the court emphasises that the moral quality the victim is ir@@ relevant , aspect which the defendants wished to highlight in their defence , as the physical and sexual liber@@ ty of a person cannot be violated under any pretext , &quot; adds the motivation .
Cor@@ by@@ n , the Bre@@ xit and the future of Europe
due to economic and demographic reasons , the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue in the coming years .
by Saturday , probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is .
even today , after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain , many are asking to what extent can we be affected by the choice of a politician who , after all , is not in a position to take decisions .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is the most radical lef@@ tist leader of the Labour Party after the war .
av@@ owed Mar@@ x@@ ist , anti @-@ mon@@ arch@@ ist ( at one point he asked Tony Blair , then prime minister , to eliminate the royal family from Buc@@ k@@ ingham Palace ) , a fierce anti @-@ American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin ( he was otherwise a regular guest of the &quot; Russia Today &quot; television channel , and he would comment political events ) . he is also a supporter of the Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist movements and wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and withdraw from NATO and the EU .
at the time , Cor@@ by@@ n thought that the killing of Osama bin Laden was a true tragedy and ISIS was almost to be preferred in comparison to the United States .
as all populist demagog@@ ues , Cor@@ by@@ n has , of course , anti @-@ austerity miracle solutions .
these kind of things were also said and promised by Tsipras in Greece until he came to close quarters with the real world and economic standards .
the economic program of the new Labour Party leader provides , among others , massive ren@@ ation@@ alisation and money printing as a solution for projects regarding financing development and coverage of generous social benefits .
sure , some might ask why the money printing solution is not widely adopted around the globe . we would then have a general worldwide prosperity ! , but who is going to beat his brain with such details .
sure we can ble@@ ed white the bankers , who became a kind of usual enemies of the left wing , but from what we have seen so often in the past , this things have happened not only in the former communist countries or Ecuador or Venezuela , but also in France , at the beginning of Mit@@ terr@@ and and Hollande &apos;s mandates .
additional amounts are quickly sw@@ allowed by generous un@@ substanti@@ ated pled@@ ges , made by populist demagog@@ ues .
as Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher used to warn , &quot; the problem of soci@@ alism is that , at some point , you run out of other people &apos;s money . &quot;
few give Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n a real chance to ever become prime minister .
in the early 8@@ 0s another radical lef@@ tist leader , Michael F@@ oo@@ t failed mis@@ er@@ ably in the elections . his beliefs were not as extreme as the one of the newly elected party leader .
but Great Britain still has a working class in the classic sense of the word , relatively consistent and structured .
unions were significantly more influential than they are now .
under the new industrial landscape , where all services are dominant in the workforce regarded as a whole , and extensive autom@@ ation has led to an industry that needed massive highly qualified man@@ power , Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s rhetoric has limited appeal .
but even as part of the opposition , he can influence important developments that may affect us directly .
in its latest issue , the Financial Times believes that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s election increases the chances of Bre@@ xit or the withdrawal of Great Britain from the EU .
the new Labour Party leader has been a consistent opponent of the country &apos;s membership in the European Union .
in the eyes of the radical left wing , Brussels is an agent of international capitalism and a promot@@ er of globalisation which imposed austerity to the poor .
when you combine this with the kind of ideas with the ones expressed by the radical right and the anti @-@ immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis that sh@@ akes up the EU , you get an explosive mix .
and this is not valid only for the United Kingdom .
but if the British decide to leave the European Union as a result of the referendum , which would take place before 2017 , the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep fault lines created within the EU by the Euro crisis and recently by that of the refugees , between North and South , between East and West , this leaves room for the most worrying scenarios .
the more so , since London has been a counter@@ weight to the Franco @-@ German axis ( in which Berlin is becoming an increasingly dominant player ) for a number of Member States .
it &apos;s true that the British business environment , the City , are strong advocates for remaining a member of the EU .
but the Europe of today is not what it used to be .
res@@ ent@@ ment is currently growing in intensity .
the recent speech of Jean Clu@@ de Jun@@ ker also revealed a problem which is that Brussels increasingly ten@@ ds to make maj@@ our decisions without consulting the great majority of Member States , asking for the opinion of just a few European powers , mainly Germany .
this is happening while the electoral support for anti @-@ system , anti @-@ immigration parties which are Eur@@ osc@@ eptic at the same time , increases dramatically across the continent .
in other words , neg@@ atively charged emotional climate has reached levels higher than ever before .
hence the conclusion that was drawn by the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Bre@@ xit .
the pro @-@ EU option is based on a cold calculation depart@@ ing from national interest .
if the voters will take the decision using their brain , then Great Britain will remain in the EU .
but Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the politics of today .
or , Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such maj@@ our developments .
as expected , this will happen especially if we will see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone , which will push most of the states in the region to the outskirts of interest and to the decision @-@ making process in Europe .
Cor@@ by@@ n , Tsipras and Syriza in Greece , Po@@ demos in Spain , even Bern@@ ie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric with the frustr@@ ations accumulated in the Western world .
due to economic and demographic reasons , the prosperity , the generous social benefits enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue in the coming years .
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis , Eurozone - immigration , both caused by hast@@ y decisions which only took into account the integration political ambitions , and not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges , turmoil on the continent , internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect Romania &apos;s situation .
it &apos;s hard to exclude possible scenarios .
the main question is whether our political leaders are able to face such difficult situations .
Constantin Brancusi , the pe@@ as@@ ant go@@ d .
Rock@@ ef@@ eller : &quot; how can I help you ? &quot;
Brancusi : &quot; take the bro@@ om and swe@@ ep the workshop ! &quot;
the great sculptor had a big dream : to be some@@ body , to get famous , to be known worldwide .
behind his reputation there is something else , something almost forgotten today . we hear millions of success stories , recipes for success in life .
that something has a name .
it &apos;s called &quot; hard work . &quot;
what else is there to be written about Constantin Brancusi ?
what is there to say , really ?
his face has appeared on bank@@ notes .
recently , a prominent bank in Romania has hired an actor to play him in a video ad .
Brancusi produces and deliv@@ ers money nearly 60 years after he is no longer with us .
in Romania , there are hundreds of streets and aven@@ ues that bear his name .
moreover , even the author of this text re@@ sides on one of these streets .
when it comes to take the off@@ spring out for a walk , he he@@ ars the following instructions : &quot; we &apos;re going to the park , to Brancusi . &quot;
the country is full of his stat@@ ues .
there are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people , from children to the elderly .
Brancusi &apos;s penetr@@ ation capacity is huge .
even the communists have failed to ex@@ tir@@ p@@ ate him from the memory and culture of Romania .
the internet is full of his quot@@ ations , receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares .
and then again , what else is there to say , to write about this man ?
seen from the pile of books and articles trying to re@@ construct his destiny , Brancusi &apos;s life seems almost fantastic , totally im@@ prob@@ able .
you know , there are people who say that if you didn &apos;t have the luck to be born in a big city , in a wealthy family , your chances for success in life are virtually n@@ il .
Brancusi &apos;s life is the perfect coun@@ tere@@ x@@ ample .
and perhaps this is the key .
perhaps the following text should start here .
with a verdict , however det@@ est@@ able it may be .
forget the stupid success stories , which are delivered daily to you in newspapers and on television .
look carefully at the face of this man .
do you want to know how he succeeded in life , how the whole world heard of him ?
it &apos;s simple .
he worked his whole life to become someone .
that &apos;s what he did .
Constantin Brancusi was born on 19 February 18@@ 76 in H@@ obi@@ ț@@ a , a small village from Pe@@ ș@@ ti@@ ș@@ ani , Gorj county , at the foot of the Carpathians .
he is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi .
although he came from a wealthy family of farmers , Brancusi lived a modest life , but one that provided his mil@@ est@@ ones which will guide his artistic vision later .
remem@@ bering his childhood and the places where he grew up , the artist was going to conf@@ ess , in a meeting with Petre Tut@@ ea , in Paris in 1933 : &quot; back then life was beautiful and harmon@@ ious . &quot;
for mil@@ len@@ nia , people were living a happy , patriar@@ ch@@ al life .
everything progres@@ sed qui@@ et@@ ly from one season to another .
and you know why things changed ?
the civiliz@@ ation of the great city reached us .
but Brancusi &apos;s childhood was far from an id@@ yl@@ lic one .
one of the moments of his first years of life is highly suggest@@ ive for the combination of pur@@ ity and violence that character@@ iz@@ ed the future sculptor &apos;s years spent in his hometown .
the moment is re@@ produced in &quot; Brancusi . a Bio@@ graphy &quot; by Alexandru Bu@@ ican .
in 18@@ 79 , Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old .
in the autumn of that year , when pl@@ um brand@@ y was made in the al@@ emb@@ ic , Brancusi was watching those who tast@@ ed the liquid to see if the process was conducted properly , and he seized a moment of in@@ attention .
he filled his cup@@ ped hands with brand@@ y and dr@@ ank in one gul@@ p .
he fell as@@ le@@ ep almost inst@@ antly .
the first people noticed after a few minutes .
his mother pan@@ ic@@ ked , then became hy@@ ster@@ ical , believing her son is dead .
in the evening , when his father , Radu , returned from the vin@@ ey@@ ard accompanied by musicians , he saw desperate signs in the distance , the signs of those who were breath@@ less@@ ly waiting for him .
the party immediately turned into sor@@ row .
the father was already thinking of the burial .
yet somehow , someone thought it would be better to call B@@ aba Brand@@ usa , a heal@@ er and serv@@ ant of the Brancusi family .
Brand@@ usa checked the child &apos;s breath , then put horse d@@ ung collected from the vicinity under his n@@ ose .
the child s@@ ne@@ ez@@ ed loudly .
the people applauded .
while the boy was allowed to sleep off his dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness , the party continued even lou@@ der and with more energy .
the next day , the father and the son meet in the or@@ ch@@ ard .
Radu Constantin Brancusi sent his son to gather some tw@@ ig@@ s and bring them to him .
the father holds his son up@@ side down and wh@@ ips him with the tw@@ ig@@ s , be@@ ats him to forever remember this .
while he feels the sting of the bl@@ ows , little Brancusi has the revel@@ ation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around him can seem over@@ turned .
the Sun &apos;s position is different from the one the boy knows , and this makes him wonder , as he later admits in his old age , that maybe the star itself brings its contribution to his trouble .
is it possible that the Sun was as troubled as his father because of what had happened to him ?
currently , the city does not work
an MP calls on the politicians to remember those who voted for them .
independent Deputy Viorel Bl@@ ă@@ ju@@ ț appealed to PSD ( Social Democrat Party ) and PNL ( Liberal National Party ) to cease their internal disputes and re@@ ori@@ ent their agenda towards the voters .
what we see now on our political scene is just a great dis@@ union and nothing more .
I have not seen any USL ( Social Liberal Union ) projects from 2012 to continue .
no highway or Regional Emergency Hospital , you only see how the politicians argue over possible locations based on real estate interests .
we should let politics aside for a time , and we should meet to talk .
currently , the city does not work .
&quot; if you &apos;re busy with an internal war , you have no time for those who elected you , &quot; said Bl@@ ă@@ ju@@ ț .
he said that the current political class has disappointed the voters of Iasi county , and the consequence will be a very low presence at the upcoming local elections , at around 30 % , which is virtually the parties &apos; loyal electorate .
the deputy also believes that the voters will increasingly focus towards traditional parties , expressing reservations towards the new political initiatives , such as the Party &quot; For I@@ a@@ ș@@ i &quot; which will be launched today .
local parties have little chance and will only break the right wing &apos;s electorate , and not the one of PSD .
such parties rely on civic active people , who are usually from the right wing .
&quot; the right wing is cr@@ um@@ bling further , which is not good for anyone , including PSD , &quot; said Bl@@ ă@@ ju@@ ț .
he said he is not interested in a candidacy for the upcoming local elections , denying the rumours of his intention to enter the race for the Mayor position .
I have already stated I do not want to run for any local position .
I &apos;ll think about whether to continue as a deputy for the next office .
I tried to make an appeal for unity for Iasi during the discussions on the h@@ all@@ ways with the other MPs , and I was accused that I want to build an image .
this is not my intention , but we cannot continue in this way .
&quot; if the people voted for us it does not mean they are stupid enough to vote for us again if they don &apos;t see anything , &quot; said Bl@@ ă@@ ju@@ ț , who stated that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected persons .
a colleague from T@@ ă@@ t@@ ă@@ ra@@ ș@@ i said that he does not have enough money and he must go by bus .
let us not be hypocr@@ ites .
money is enough .
sometimes I &apos;m ashamed to take my money from the cas@@ hi@@ er &apos;s office .
at the end of the office I will report everything I spent besides the cabinet employees &apos; salaries and its maintenance .
one month I happened to collect 30,000 lei with the reimb@@ ur@@ sements for transport , accommodation and other expenses .
&quot; to say that an MP does not have enough money is pure hypocrisy &quot; concluded little Bl@@ ă@@ ju@@ ț .
