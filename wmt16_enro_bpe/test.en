UN Chief S@@ ays Th@@ ere Is No Military S@@ olution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s stepped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.@@ S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l N@@ um@@ bers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a f@@ li@@ p @-@ Fl@@ op@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an impl@@ osion .
but no matter how some Republ@@ ic@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from at@@ op the polls , it h@@ asn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gul &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
p@@ und@@ its point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Jeb Bush &apos;s Super p@@ ac and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogn@@ iz@@ ing Trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to top@@ ple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gul isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
tr@@ ump &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 per@@ cent .
in early August , it was 52 per@@ cent .
now , six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans have a favor@@ able view of Donald Trump .
r@@ oughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ n@@ ipi@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 per@@ cent of Republ@@ ic@@ ans there had a favor@@ able view of Trump .
two @-@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Trump as the nomin@@ ee .
in a CNN / O@@ RC poll last week , 67 per@@ cent of Republ@@ ic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trump were the nomin@@ ee .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the nomin@@ ee .
only Ben Carson generates r@@ oughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 per@@ cent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs . 40 per@@ cent who say the same of Trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per@@ cent .
on the f@@ li@@ p side , 47 per@@ cent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nomin@@ ee .
a majority of Republ@@ ic@@ ans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Trump has been widely critic@@ iz@@ ed for his bomb@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 per@@ cent of le@@ an@@ ed Republican voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gul has the right temper@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation cauc@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 per@@ cent of Republ@@ ic@@ ans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ n@@ ipi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 per@@ cent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his temper@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their P@@ und@@ it hats , Republican voters think Trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nomination , four in 10 said Trump was the best bet , according to a CNN / O@@ RC poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ op voters haven &apos;t had the clea@@ rest cr@@ ystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans pic@@ ked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 per@@ cent for eventual nomin@@ ee Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a plur@@ ality of G@@ O@@ P voters see Trump &apos;s campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if Republ@@ ic@@ ans ral@@ lied around another candidate , Trump still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some p@@ und@@ its point out that the spl@@ int@@ ered field is likely contributing to Trump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ Trump support is be spread dif@@ fus@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads Car@@ ly F@@ ior@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Ru@@ bio by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Jeb Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ and Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cr@@ uz .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypo@@ th@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a b@@ are majority of Donald Trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 per@@ cent said they are leaving the door open to swit@@ ching candidates .
still , Trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ sider neur@@ os@@ urg@@ eon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump .
six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rapists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and cent@@ er in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that Trump &apos;s bomb@@ ast will drive crucial H@@ is@@ panic voters away from the Republican Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climb@@ ing to new high@@ s .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for r@@ oughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ sider status .
six in 10 Republ@@ ic@@ ans in Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll say they want a political out@@ sider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Republ@@ ic@@ ans are frustrated with Republ@@ ic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per@@ cent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per@@ cent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awaited
new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Quest@@ ions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six all@@ ot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrutin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
he has also said he could sk@@ ip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the en@@ counter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s New@@ s@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent Robin Br@@ ant says policy differences are also &quot; stac@@ king up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 2@@ 6,000 to £ 2@@ 3,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the desp@@ atch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Isl@@ ing@@ ton North MP has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both &quot; re@@ part@@ ee &quot; and trading barb@@ s , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eag@@ le , the shadow business secretary , will depu@@ ti@@ se for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Comm@@ ons Speaker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; punc@@ h and Jud@@ y &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ om@@ eter of a leader &apos;s judg@@ ement , their command of the Comm@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caric@@ ature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .
